Jacobi often solved difficult problems by following a simple strategy: “_man muss_ immer umkehren” (or loosely translated, “invert, always invert.”)\n\n“\\[Jacobi\\] knew that it is in the nature of things that many hard problems are best solved when they are addressed backward,” Munger counsels.\n\nWhile Jacobi applied inversion mostly to mathematics, the model is one of the most powerful [mental models](https://fs.blog/mental-models/) in our toolkit.\n\nIt is not enough to think about difficult problems one way. You need to think about them forwards and backward. Inversion often forces you to uncover hidden beliefs about the problem you are trying to solve. “Indeed,” says Munger, “many problems can’t be solved forward.”\n\nLet’s take a look at some examples. Say you want to improve innovation in your organization. Thinking forward, you’d think about all of the things you could do to foster innovation. If you look at the problem by inversion, however, you’d think about all the things you could do that would discourage innovation. Ideally, you’d avoid those things. Sounds simple right? I bet your organization does some of those ‘stupid’ things today.\n\nAnother example, rather than think about what makes a good life, you can think about what prescriptions would ensure misery.\n\n## Avoiding stupidity is easier than seeking brilliance.\n\nWhile both thinking forward and thinking backward result in some action, you can think of them as _additive_ vs. _subtractive_.\n\nDespite our best intentions, thinking forward increases the odds that you’ll cause harm ([iatrogenics](https://fs.blog/2013/10/iatrogenics/)). Thinking backward, call it subtractive avoidance or inversion, is less likely to cause harm.\n\nInverting the problem won’t always solve it, but it will help you avoid trouble. You can think of it as the avoiding stupidity filter. It’s not sexy but it’s a very easy way to improve.\n\n**So what does this mean in practice?**\n\nSpending time thinking about the opposite of what you want doesn’t come naturally to most people. And yet many of the smartest people in history, have done this naturally.\n\nInversion helps improve understanding of the problem. By forcing you to do [the work necessary to have an opinion](https://fs.blog/2013/04/the-work-required-to-have-an-opinion/) you’re forced to consider different perspectives.\n\nIf you’re to take anything away from inversion let it be this: Spend less time trying to be brilliant and more time trying to avoid obvious stupidity. The kicker? [Avoiding stupidity is easier than seeking brilliance](https://fs.blog/2014/06/avoiding-stupidity/).\n\n_Inversion is part of the [Farnam Street Latticework of Mental Models.](https://fs.blog/mental-models/)_\n",

What is important is knowing when you are approaching the perimeter.\n\nWithin your circle of competence, you operate with an advantage. As you approach the perimeter (the limitations of your knowledge), your advantage starts to reduce. As you cross the perimeter, not only does your advantage vanish, but it transfers to other people. Suddenly, you find yourself playing in an area where others have an edge.\n\nJust because you are good at something doesn’t mean you are good at everything.\n\nA Grandmaster in chess is at home on the chessboard, but those skills don’t translate into being competent in other areas of life, such as cooking in the kitchen. In fact, it’s often the case that extreme skills in one area create extreme weaknesses in others.\n\n> I want to think about things where I have an advantage over other people. I don’t want to play a game where people have an advantage over me. I don’t play in a game where other people are wise and I am stupid. I look for a game where I am wise and they are stupid. And believe me it works better. God bless our stupid competitors. They make us rich.\n> \n> Charlie Munger\n\nAs we cross the perimeter from what we know to what we don’t, confidence does not diminish as fast as competence. The biggest risk when operating outside of your circle of competence is what you don’t see.\n\nWhile most people are concerned with the _size_ of their circle, it’s a lot more important to know when you are approaching the _perimeter_.\n\n## Circle Of Competence\n\n> I’m no genius. I’m smart in spots—but I stay around those spots.\n> \n> Tom Watson Sr., Founder of IBM\n\nWarren Buffett [described](http://www.tilsonfunds.com/BuffettNotreDame.pdf) circle of competence using one of his former business managers, Rose Blumkin, a Russian immigrant with poor English who built the largest furniture store in Nebraska:\n\n> I couldn’t have given her $200 million worth of Berkshire Hathaway stock when I bought the business because she doesn’t understand stock. She understands cash. She understands furniture. She understands real estate. She doesn’t understand stocks, so she doesn’t have anything to do with them. If you deal with Mrs. B in what I would call her circle of competence… She is going to buy 5,000 end tables this afternoon (if the price is right). She is going to buy 20 different carpets in odd lots, and everything else like that \\[snaps fingers\\] because she understands carpet. She wouldn’t buy 100 shares of General Motors if it was at 50 cents a share.\n\nIt did not hurt Mrs. B to have such a narrow area of competence. In fact, one could argue the opposite. Her rigid devotion to that area allowed her to focus. Only by focusing on one thing could she overcome her handicaps and achieve such extreme success.\n\n[Charlie Munger](https://fs.blog/charlie-munger/) applies the concept to life in general. He sought to answer the essential question: Where should we devote our limited time to achieve the most success?\n\n> You have to figure out what your own aptitudes are. If you play games where other people have the aptitudes and you don’t, you’re going to lose. And that’s as close to certain as any prediction that you can make. You have to figure out where you’ve got an edge. And you’ve got to play within your own circle of competence.\n> \n> If you want to be the best tennis player in the world, you may start out trying and soon find out that it’s hopeless—that other people blow right by you. However, if you want to become the best plumbing contractor in Bemidji, that is probably doable by two-thirds of you. It takes a will. It takes the intelligence. But after a while, you’d gradually know all about the plumbing business in Bemidji and master the art. That is an attainable objective, given enough discipline. And people who could never win a chess tournament or stand in center court in a respectable tennis tournament can rise quite high in life by slowly developing a circle of competence—which results partly from what they were born with and partly from what they slowly develop through work.\n\nIt becomes easier to stay within your circle of competence when you focus on outcome over ego.\n\nWhen asked why Berkshire Hathaway hasn’t invested in pharmaceuticals, Charlie Munger responded:[1](#footnote-1)\n\n> By and large, we haven’t invested in pharmaceuticals because we’ve got no edge. I don’t know enough about biology and medicine and chemistry to have any edge in guessing which new pharmaceutical attempt is likely to succeed and other people who know those things, not that they have perfect knowledge, but it’s wa",

      "content": "\n## What Are Mental Models?\n\nA mental model is a simplified explanation of how something works.\n\nAny idea, belief, or concept can be boiled down to its essence. Like a map, mental models highlight key information while ignoring irrelevant details. They’re tools for compressing complexity into manageable chunks.\n\nMental models help us understand the world. For example, velocity shows that both speed and direction matter. Reciprocity reveals how being positive and taking initiative gets the world to do most of the work for you. Margin of Safety reminds us that things don’t always go as planned. Relativity exposes our blind spots and shows how a different perspective can reveal new information. These are just a few examples.\n\n> If you want to be a good thinker, you must develop a mind that can jump the jurisdictional boundaries. You don’t have to know it all. Just take in the best big ideas from all these disciplines. And it’s not that hard to do.\n> \n> Charlie Munger\n\n## The Big Ideas From The Big Disciplines\n\nThis page summarizes the big ideas to help you make better decisions, avoid problems, and spot opportunities others miss.\n\n*   [General Thinking Tools](#general_thinking_concepts)\n*   [Physics, Chemistry, and Biology](#physics_and_chemistry)\n*   [Systems](#systems)\n*   [Numeracy](#numeracy)\n*   [Microeconomics](#microeconomics)\n*   [Military and War](#military_and_war)\n*   [Human Nature and Judgment](#human_nature_and_judgment)\n\n[![](https://fs.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Tgmm-1024x458.png)](https://fs.blog/tgmm)\n\n## General Thinking Tools\n\n**[The Map is Not the Territory](https://fs.blog/map-and-territory/)**\n\nThe map is not the territory reminds us that our mental models of the world are not the same as the world itself. It cautions against confusing our abstractions and representations with the complex, ever-­shifting reality they aim to describe.\n\nIt is dangerous to mistake the map for the territory. Consider the person with an outstanding résumé who checks all the boxes on paper but can’t do the job.\n\nUpdating our maps is a difficult process of reconciling what we want to be true with what is true.\n\nIn many areas of life, we are offered maps by other people. We are reliant on the maps provided by experts, pundits, and teachers. In these cases, the best we can do is to choose our mapmakers wisely and to seek out those who are rigorous, transparent, and open to revision.\n\nUltimately, the map/territory distinction invites us to engage with the world as it is, not just as we imagine it. And remember, when you don’t make the map, choose your cartographer wisely.\n\n**[Circle of Competence](https://fs.blog/circle-of-competence/)**\n\nThe first rule of competition is that you are more likely to win if you play where you have an advantage. Playing to your advantage requires a firm understanding of what you know and don’t know.\n\nYour circle of competence is your personal sphere of expertise, where your knowledge and skills are concentrated. It’s the domain where you have a deep understanding, where your judgments are reliable, and your decisions are sound. \n\nThe size of your circle isn’t as important as knowing the boundaries. The wise person knows the limits of their knowledge and can confidently say, “This falls within my circle,” or “This is outside my area of expertise.” \n\nWhile operating within your circle of competence is a recipe for confidence and effectiveness, venturing outside your circle of competence is a recipe for trouble. You’re like a sailor navigating unfamiliar waters without a map, at the mercy of currents and storms you don’t fully understand. This isn’t to say that you should never venture outside your circle. Learning new things, gaining new skills, and mastering new domains is one of the most beautiful things about life. \n\nCelebrate your expertise, but also acknowledge your limitations.\n\n**[First Principles Thinking](https://fs.blog/first-principles/)**\n\nFirst principles thinking is the art of breaking down complex problems into their fundamental truths. It’s a way of thinking that goes beyond the surface and allows us to see things from a new perspective.\n\nThinking in first principles allows us to identify the root causes, strip away the layers of complexity, and focus on the most effective solutions. Reasoning from first principles allows us to step outside the way things have always been done and instead see what is possible.\n\nFirst principles thinking is not easy. It requires a willingness to challenge the status quo. This is why it’s often the domain of rebels and disrupters who believe there must be a better way. It’s the thinking of those willing to start from scratch and build from the ground up.\n\nIn a world focused on incremental improvement, first principles thinking offers a competitive advantage because almost no one does it.\n\n**[Thought Experiment](https://fs.blog/thought-experiment/)**\n\nThought experiments are the sandbox of the mind, the place where we can play with ide",

But it goes beyond that: this will remove the need for regular people in our economy. Powerful actors—like states and companies—no longer have an incentive to care about regular people. We call this **the intelligence curse**.\n\nIf we do nothing, the intelligence curse will work like this:\n\n*   Powerful AI will push automation through existing organizations, starting from the bottom and moving to the top.\n*   AI will obsolete even outlier human talent. Social mobility will stop, ending the social dynamism and progress that it drives.\n*   Non-human factors of production, like capital, resources, and control over AI, will become overwhelmingly more important than humans.\n*   This will usher in incentives for powerful actors around the world that break the modern social contract.\n*   This could result in the [gradual](https://gradual-disempowerment.ai/)—or [sudden](https://www.forethought.org/research/ai-enabled-coups-how-a-small-group-could-use-ai-to-seize-power)—disempowerment of the vast majority of humanity.\n\nBut this prophecy is not yet fulfilled; we _reject_ the view that this path is inevitable. We see a different future on the horizon, but it will require a deliberate and concerted effort to achieve it.\n\nWe aim to change the incentives driving the intelligence curse, maintaining human economic relevance and strengthening our democratic institutions to withstand what will likely be the greatest societal disruption in history.\n\nTo break the intelligence curse, we should chart a different path on the tech tree_,_ building technology that lets us:\n\n1.  **Avert** AI catastrophes by hardening the world against them, both because it is good in itself and because it removes the security threats that drive calls for centralization.\n2.  **Diffuse** AI, to get it in the hands of regular people.

In the long-term, align AI directly to individual users and give everyone control in the AI economy.\n3.  **Democratize** institutions, making them more anchored to the needs of humans even as they are buffeted by the changing incentive landscape and fast-moving events of the AGI transition.\n\nIn this series of essays, we examine the incoming crisis of human irrelevance and provide a map towards a future where people remain the masters of their destiny.\n\n* * *\n\n## Chapters\n\n### 1\\. **Introduction** (this page)\n\nWe will soon live in the intelligence age.

      "content": "\nFirst principles thinking is one of the best ways to discover new solutions.\n\nSometimes called “reasoning from first principles,” it’s a tool to help break down complicated problems by separating what we know is absolutely true from anything that is an assumption. What remains are the essentials. If you know the first principles of something, you can build the rest of your knowledge around them to produce something new.\n\nWhile you could take this way of thinking down to an atomic level, a lot of value is gained by simply going a level or two deeper than most people. Solutions are based on what you see. Different answers reveal themselves at different levels.\n\nIf I hand you a house made from Lego blocks, you know it’s possible to make a house. Thinking at the first layer, you might move a few blocks around and, in the process, slightly improve the house. Most people stop here. They are presented with something that already exists and they endeavor to make it slightly better. Going a layer deeper and breaking the Lego house into individual pieces opens the door to possibility: not only can you build a better house, you can build something entirely different.\n\nEverything that exists is effectively a set of Lego blocks, assembled in a certain way, that can be taken apart and reassembled. A bike is just a seat, chain, body, handlebars, etc. Breaking the bike down into its parts allows you to reassemble the parts into something new. However, you can also go deeper, melting the parts into their core metals and making a shield, sword, or anything else, limited only by material and imagination.\n\n> I don’t know what’s the matter with people: they don’t learn by understanding; they learn by some other way—by rote or something. Their knowledge is so fragile!\n> \n> Richard Feynman\n\n## The Basics\n\nThe idea of building knowledge from first principles has a long tradition in philosophy. In the Western canon, it goes back to Plato, with significant contributions from Aristotle and Descartes. Essentially, these thinkers sought foundational knowledge that would remain constant and serve as a basis for building everything else, from our ethical systems to our social structures.\n\n![First Principles](https://fs.blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/first-principles-white.jpg)\n\nFirst principles thinking doesn’t have to be quite so grand. When we do it, we aren’t necessarily looking for absolute truths—millennia of epistemological inquiry have shown us that these are hard to come by, and the scientific method has demonstrated that knowledge can be built only when we are actively trying to falsify it. Rather, first principles thinking identifies the elements that are, in the context of any given situation, irreducible.\n\nFirst principles do not provide a checklist of things that will always be true; our understanding of first principles evolves as we gain more knowledge. They are the foundation on which we must build, and thus will be different in every situation—but the more we know, the more we can challenge. For example, if we are considering how to improve the energy efficiency of a refrigerator, the laws of thermodynamics can be taken as first principles. However, a theoretical chemist or physicist might want to explore entropy, and thus further break the second law of thermodynamics into its underlying principles and the assumptions that were made because of them.\n\n> “To understand is to know what to do.”\n> \n> — Wittgenstein\n\n## Techniques for Establishing First Principles\n\nIf we never learn to take something apart, test our assumptions about it, and reconstruct it, we end up bound by what other people tell us is possible. We end up trapped in the way things have always been done. When the environment changes, we just continue as if things were the same, making costly mistakes along the way.\n\nSome of us are naturally skeptical of what we’re told: Maybe it doesn’t match up to our experiences. Maybe it’s something that used to be true but isn’t true anymore. Or maybe we just think differently about something. When it comes down to it, everything that is not a law of nature is just a shared belief. Money is a shared belief. So is a border. So is Bitcoin. So is love. The list goes on.\n\nThere are two techniques we can use to change the level where we are looking at a situation, identify the first principles, and cut through the dogma and shared belief: Socratic questioning and the Five Whys.\n\n### Socratic Questioning\n\nSocratic questioning can be used to establish first principles through stringent analysis. This a disciplined questioning process, used to establish truths, reveal underlying assumptions, and separate knowledge from ignorance. The key distinction between Socratic questioning and normal discussions is that the former seeks to draw out first principles in a systematic manner. Socratic questioning generally follows this process:\n\n1.  Clarifying your thinking and explaining the origins of your ideas (Why do I think this? What e",
