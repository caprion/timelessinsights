McRaven delivers an amazing University of Texas at Austin 2014 Commencement Address.\n\nReturning to his alma mater last week, he provided graduating seniors ten life lessons from a navy SEAL.\n\nThe video of the full speech appears below this abbreviated transcript.\n\n> The University’s slogan is,\n> \n> “What starts here changes the world.”\n> \n> I have to admit—I kinda like it.\n> \n> “What starts here changes the world.”\n> \n> Tonight there are almost 8,000 students graduating from UT.\n> \n> That great paragon of analytical rigor, Ask.Com says that the average American will meet 10,000 people in their lifetime.\n> \n> That’s a lot of folks.\n> \n> But, if every one of you changed the lives of just ten people—and each one of those folks changed the lives of another ten people—just ten—then in five generations—125 years—the class of 2014 will have changed the lives of 800 million people.\n> \n> 800 million people—think of it—over twice the population of the United States. Go one more generation and you can change the entire population of the world—8 billion people.\n> \n> If you think it’s hard to change the lives of ten people—change their lives forever—you’re wrong.\n> \n> I saw it happen every day in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n> \n> A young Army officer makes a decision to go left instead of right down a road in Baghdad and the ten soldiers in his squad are saved from close-in ambush.\n> \n> In Kandahar province, Afghanistan, a non-commissioned officer from the Female Engagement Team senses something isn’t right and directs the infantry platoon away from a 500 pound IED, saving the lives of a dozen soldiers.\n> \n> But, if you think about it, not only were these soldiers saved by the decisions of one person, but their children yet unborn—were also saved. And their children’s children—were saved.\n> \n> Generations were saved by one decision—by one person.\n> \n> But changing the world can happen anywhere and anyone can do it.\n> \n> So, what starts here can indeed change the world, but the question is…what will the world look like after you change it?\n> \n> Well, I am confident that it will look much, much better, but if you will humor this old sailor for just a moment, I have a few suggestions that may help you on your way to a better a world.\n> \n> And while these lessons were learned during my time in the military, I can assure you that it matters not whether you ever served a day in uniform.\n> \n> It matters not your gender, your ethnic or religious background, your orientation, or your social status.\n> \n> Our struggles in this world are similar and the lessons to overcome those struggles and to move forward—changing ourselves and the world around us—will apply equally to all.\n> \n> I have been a Navy SEAL for 36 years. But it all began when I left UT for Basic SEAL training in Coronado, California.\n> \n> Basic SEAL training is six months of long torturous runs in the soft sand, midnight swims in the cold water off San Diego, obstacles courses, unending calisthenics, days without sleep and always being cold, wet and miserable.\n> \n> It is six months of being constantly harassed by professionally trained warriors who seek to find the weak of mind and body and eliminate them from ever becoming a Navy SEAL.\n> \n> But, the training also seeks to find those students who can lead in an environment of constant stress, chaos, failure and hardships.\n> \n> To me basic SEAL training was a life time of challenges crammed into six months.\n> \n> So, here are the ten lessons I learned from basic SEAL training that hopefully will be of value to you as you move forward in life.\n> \n> Every morning in basic SEAL training, my instructors, who at the time were all Vietnam veterans, would show up in my barracks room and the first thing they would inspect was your bed.\n> \n> If you did it right, the corners would be square, the covers pulled tight, the pillow centered just under the headboard and the extra blanket folded neatly at the foot of the rack—rack—that’s Navy talk for bed.\n> \n> It was a simple task—mundane at best. But every morning we were required to make our bed to perfection. It seemed a little ridiculous at the time, particularly in light of the fact that were aspiring to be real warriors, tough battle hardened SEALs—but the wisdom of this simple act has been proven to me many times over.\n> \n> If you make your bed every morning you will have accomplished the first task of the day. It will give you a small sense of pride and it will encourage you to do another task and another and another.\n> \n> By the end of the day, that one task completed will have turned into many tasks completed. Making your bed will also reinforce the fact that little things in life matter.\n> \n> If you can’t do the little things right, you will never do the big things right.\n> \n> And, if by chance you have a miserable day, you will come home to a bed that is made—that ",

Through the stories, we see not only how he leads, but how changing circumstances led to him changing.\n\nHere are some of the lessons in _My Share of the Task_.\n\n**1\\. Leadership is the single biggest reason for success or failure.**\n\n> So, after a lifetime, what had I learned about leadership? Probably not enough. But I saw enough for me to believe it was the single biggest reason organizations succeeded or failed. It dwarfed numbers, technology, ideology, and historical forces in determining the outcome of events. I used to tell junior leaders that the nine otherwise identical parachute infantry battalions of the 82nd Airborne Division ranged widely in effectiveness, the disparity almost entirely a function of leadership.\n> \n> “Switch just two people— the battalion commander and command sergeant major—from the best battalion with those of the worst, and within ninety days the relative effectiveness of the battalions will have switched as well,” I’d say. I still believe I was correct.\n\n**2\\. Leadership is difficult to measure.**\n\n> Yet leadership is difficult to measure and often difficult even to adequately describe. I lack the academic bona fides to provide a scholarly analysis of leadership and human behavior. So I’ll simply relate what, after a lifetime of being led and learning to lead, I’ve concluded.\n> \n> Leadership is the art of influencing others. It differs from giving a simple order or managing in that it shapes the longer-term attitudes and behavior of individuals and groups. George Washington’s tattered army persisted to ultimate victory. Those troops displayed the kind of effort that can never be ordered— only evoked. Effective leaders stir an intangible but very real desire inside people. That drive can be reflected in extraordinary courage, selfless sacrifice, and commitment.\n\n**3\\. Leadership is neither good nor evil.**\n\n> We like to equate leaders with values we admire, but the two can be separate and distinct. Self-serving or evil intent motivated some of the most effective leaders I saw, like Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. In the end, leadership is a skill that can be used like any other, but with far greater effect.\n\n**4\\. Leaders take us to where we’d otherwise not go.**\n\n> Although Englishmen rushing into the breach behind Henry V is a familiar image, leaders whose personal example or patient persuasion causes dramatic changes in otherwise inertia-bound organizations or societies are far more significant. The teacher who awakens and encourages in students a sense of possibility and responsibility is, to me, the ultimate leader.\n\n**5\\. Success is rarely the work of a single leader.**\n\n> … leaders work best in partnership with other leaders. In Iraq in 2004, I received specific direction to track Zarqawi and bring him to justice. But it was the collaboration of leaders below me, inside TF 714, that built the teams, relentlessly hunted, and ultimately destroyed his lethal network.\n\n**6\\. Leaders are empathetic.**\n\n> The best leaders I’ve seen have an uncanny ability to understand, empathize, and communicate with those they lead. They need not agree or share the same background or status in society as their followers, but they understand their hopes, fears, and passions. Great leaders intuitively sense, or simply ask, how people feel and what resonates with them. At their worst, demigods like Adolf Hitler manipulate the passions of frustrated populations into misguided forces. But empathy can be remarkably positive when a Nelson Mandela reshapes and redirects the energy of a movement away from violence and into constructive nation-building.\n\n**7\\. Leadership is not popularity.**\n\n> For soldiers, the choice between popularity and effectiveness is ultimately no choice at all. Soldiers want to win; their survival depends upon it. They will accept, and even take pride in, the quirks and shortcomings of a leader if they believe he or she can produce success.\n\n**8\\. The best leaders are genuine.**\n\n> I found soldiers would tolerate my being less of a leader than I hoped to be, but they would not forgive me being less than I claimed to ",

This is true of the art of producing ideas.\n> \n> Particular bits of knowledge are nothing, because they are made up of what Dr. Robert Hutchins once called rapidly aging facts. Principles and method are everything.\n> \n> \\[…\\]\n> \n> So with the art of producing ideas. What is most valuable to know is not where to look for a particular idea, but how to train the mind in the method by which all ideas are produced and how to grasp the principles which are at the source of all ideas.\n\n[Echoing Einstein](https://www.farnamstreetblog.com/2014/04/einstein-productive-thought-combinatory-creativity/), Webb believed that the key to creativity could be found in new combinations of old things.\n\n> With regard to the general principles which underlie the production of ideas, it seems to me that there are two which are important.\n> \n> The first of these has already been touched upon in the quotation from Pareto: namely, that **an idea is nothing more or less than a new combination of old elements.**\n> \n> This is, perhaps the most important fact in connection with the production of ideas.\n> \n> \\[…\\]\n> \n> The second important principle involved is that the capacity to bring old elements into new combinations depends largely on the ability to see relationships.\n> \n> Here, I suspect, is where minds differ to the greatest degree when it comes to the production of ideas. To some minds each fact is a separate bit of knowledge. To others it is a link in a chain of knowledge. It has relationships and similarities. It is not so much a fact as it is an illustration of a general law applying to a whole series of facts.\n> \n> \\[…\\]\n> \n> Consequently **the habit of mind which leads to a search for relationships between facts becomes of the highest importance in the production of ideas.**\n\nYoung expands on the notion that combinations, and thus relationships and connections between ideas, are the key.\n\n> An idea is nothing more nor less than a new combination of old elements \\[and\\] the capacity to bring old elements into new combinations depends largely on the ability to see relationships. The habit of mind which leads to a search for relationships between facts becomes of the highest importance in the production of ideas.\n\nThe process he advises involves 5 steps.\n\nWhile we will all be familiar with each individual step, it is more important to recognize their relationship and “grasp the fact that the mind follows these five steps in definite order.”\n\n**1\\. Gather Raw Material**\n\n> Gathering raw material in a real way is not as simple as it sounds. It is such a terrible chore that we are constantly trying to dodge it. The time that ought to be spent in material gathering is spent in wool gathering. Instead of working systematically at the job of gathering raw material we sit around hoping for inspiration to strike us. When we do that we are trying to get the mind to take the fourth step in the idea-producing process while we dodge the preceding steps.\n> \n> The materials which must be gathered are of two kinds: they are specific and they are general.\n\nPart of this is what you set out to do when you create an idea and part of it is a life-long curiosity.\n\n“Before passin",

Scott Peck\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n## The Basics\n\nThe sense that we are not being listened to is one of the most frustrating feelings imaginable. Toddlers scream about it, teenagers move out, couples split up, companies breakdown.\n\nOne of the main reasons this breakdown in communication occurs is that listening (like reading, thinking clearly and focusing) is a skill which we rarely consider to be something requiring knowledge and practice.\n\n**There is a difference between hearing and listening.**\n\nWe assume that, as long as we can hear someone and understand their words that we are listening. Hearing alone, however, is not enough. Among other things, we need to comprehend what’s being said and why, reflect on intentions, and consider non-verbal communication.\n\nListening is one of the foundations of society – it is what enables us to form meaningful relationships and connections. And yet most of us haven’t thought about how we listen.\n\nAs Mortimer J. Adler writes in [How to Speak, How to Listen](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0684846470/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=farnamstreet-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0684846470&linkId=0dbfa08c3086cd23c7956fa52624747b):\n\n> We all realize that the ability to read requires training…the same would appear to be true of speaking and listening … training is required … Likewise, skill in listening is either a native gift or it must be acquired by training.\n\nActive listening is a technique for developing our ability to listen.\n\nAs a communication technique, it is used in many professional settings but is also valuable for everyday life. Anyone who has ever seen a good therapist will be familiar with the efficacy of active listening. A one-to-one therapist will listen with intent, clarify any uncertain points, often paraphrase what is said and ask the speaker to expand. A family or couple therapist will help to resolve a conflict by facilitating calm communication through reflection, open body language, and by helping couples understand one another.\n\nAs Sheldon B. Kopp writes:\n\n> The therapist can interpret, advise, provide the emotional acceptance and support that nurtures personal growth, and above all, he can listen. I do not mean that he can simply hear the other, but that he will listen actively and purposefully, responding with the instrument of his trade that is, with the personal vulnerability of his own trembling self. This listening is that which will facilitate the patient’s telling of his tale, the telling that can set him free.\n\nFor the sake of clarity, we will refer to active listening in the context of two people conversing throughout this article. However, it can occur in communication between multiple people and in groups.\n\n\\[quote\\]Listening is difficult because it involves suppressing your ego long enough to consider what is being said before you respond.\\[/quote\\]\n\n## The Core Components of Active Listening\n\n**Comprehending**\n\nTo communicate, we must first understand what the other person (or people) are actually saying. This is not as simple as it appears.\n\nIn most cases, comprehension occurs instantly and unconsciously. However, a number of potential barriers can prevent comprehension, including:\n\n*   Language barriers.\n*   The use of [jargon or slang](https://www.farnamstreetblog.com/2013/04/the-emperor-has-no-clothes/).\n*   Difference in culture, age, social rank and other discrepancies between people.\n\nIn [Eyes Wide Open](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0143129570/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=farnamstreet-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0143129570&linkId=8f949719b990b8c3a54d80bf9b23875d), Isaac Lidsky recommends simplifying comprehension by asking ‘can you explain that like I’m five years old?.’ This is the same technique we use to [rapidly improve learning](https://www.farnamstreetblog.com/2012/04/learn-anything-faster-with-the-feynman-technique/). Removing jargon and explaining things in your own language results in massively improved comprehension of complex topics.\n\n**Retaining**\n\nTo respond in an appropriate manner, we must understand and retain what the other person has said. Not everyone will retain the same details.\n\nSome people recall very specific details, while others hold on to the general idea. It is common for us to only retain details which are relevant for our response.\n\nWhen actively listening, we focus on the other person’s words, rather than thinking about what we can say next. Suppressing our ego is difficult. It’s as if we think we already know what the other person is going to say. And we fool ourselves into thinking that [we’ve done the work](https://www.farnamstreetblog.com/2013/04/the-work-required-to-have-an-opinion/): that we not only know what the other person will say but that we’ve thought about it before. Only, we haven’t.\n\nThere are a number of potential barriers to retention, includi",

We create models (a term with many applications), once to confuse them for reality.\n\nBox also stated:\n\n> Remember that all models are wrong; the practical question is how wrong do they have to be to not be useful.\n\n## What Exactly Is A Model?\n\nFirst, we should understand precisely what a model is.\n\nThe dictionary definition states a model is ‘a representation, generally in miniature, to show the construction or appearance of something’ or ‘a simplified description, especially a mathematical one, of a system or process, to assist calculations and predictions.’\n\nFor our purposes here, we are better served by the second definition. A model is a simplification which fosters understanding.\n\nThink of an architectural model. These are typically a small scale model of a building, made before it’s built. Its purpose is to show what the building will look like and to help people working on the project to develop a clear picture of the overall feel. In the iconic scene from Zoolander, Derek (played by Ben Stiller) looks at the architectural model of his propsed ‘school for kids who can’t read good’ and shouts “What is this? A center for ants??”\n\nThat scene illustrates the wrong way to understand models: Too literally.\n\n## Why We Use Models- And Why They Work\n\nAt Farnam Street, we believe in using models for the purpose of building a massive, but finite amount of fundamental, invariant knowledge about [how the world really works](https://www.farnamstreetblog.com/2016/02/joseph-tussman/). Applying this knowledge is the key to [making good decisions](https://www.farnamstreetblog.com/smart-decisions/) and [avoiding stupidity](https://www.farnamstreetblog.com/2013/10/inversion/).\n\n> “Scientists generally agree that no theory is 100 percent correct. Thus, the real test of knowledge is not truth, but utility. Science gives us power. The more useful that power, the better the science.”\n> \n> — Yuval Noah Harari\n\nTime-tested models allow us to understand how things work in the real world. And understanding how things work prepares us to make better decisions without expending too much mental energy in the process.\n\nInstead of relying on fickle and specialized facts, we can learn versatile concepts. The [mental models](https://www.farnamstreetblog.com/mental-models/) we cover are intended to be widely applicable.\n\nIt’s crucial for us to understand as many mental models as possible. As the adage goes, a little knowledge can be dangerous and creates more problems than total ignorance. No single model is universally applicable – we find exceptions for nearly everything. Even hardcore physics has not been totally solved.\n\n> “The basic trouble, you see, is that people think that “right” and “wrong” are absolute; that everything that isn’t perfectly and completely right is totally and equally wrong.”\n> \n> — Isaac Asimov\n\nTake a look at almost any comment section on the internet and you are guaranteed to find at least one pedant raging about a minor perceived inaccuracy, throwing out the good with the bad. While ignorance and misinformation are certainly not laudable, neither is an obsession with perfection.\n\nLike heuristics, models work as a consequence of the fact they are usually helpful in most situations, not because they are always helpful in a small number of situations.\n\nModels can assist us in making predictions and forecasting the future. Forecasts are never guaranteed, yet they provide us with a degree of preparedness and comprehension of the future. For example, a weather forecast which claims it will rain today may get that wrong. Still, it’s correct often enough to enable us to plan appropriately and bring an umbrella.\n\n## Mental Models and Minimum Viable Products\n\nThink of mental models as minimum viable products.\n\nSure, all of them can be improved. But the only way that can happen is if we try them out, educate ourselves and collectively refine them.\n\nWe can apply one of our mental models, [Occam’s razor](https://www.farnamstreetblog.com/2017/05/mental-model-occams-razor/), to this. Occam’s razor states that the simplest solution is usually correct. In the same way, our simplest mental models tend to be the most useful. This is because there is minimal room for errors a",

      "content": "\nThe path to success often comes through avoiding major mistakes rather than pursuing brilliant moves. This isn’t about being passive – it’s about being thoughtful and disciplined about where and how you compete.\n\nSuccess comes from playing where you have an edge, ensuring you’re properly compensated for risks, and maintaining both financial and psychological staying power. Patience is crucial – many fail simply because they can’t wait long enough for their strategy to work.\n\nThe foundation of this approach is understanding which type of game you’re playing. There are two fundamental types.\n\n> It is remarkable how much long-term advantage people like us have gotten by trying to be consistently not stupid, instead of trying to be very intelligent.\n> \n> Charlie Munger\n\n## Winning or Losing?\n\nSimon Ramo’s book _Extraordinary Tennis Ordinary Players_ illustrates a crucial distinction between professional and amateur games.\n\nIn professional tennis, players win points through skill – placing shots just beyond their opponent’s reach through precise control, spin, and positioning. The outcome largely depends on their own performance.\n\nAmateur tennis is fundamentally different. Amateurs don’t win points so much as lose them through errors – hitting balls into the net, serving double faults, or sending shots far beyond the lines. This distinction between winning and losing games extends far beyond tennis.\n\n> In expert tennis, about 80 per cent of the points are won; in amateur tennis, about 80 per cent of the points are lost. In other words, professional tennis is a Winner’s Game – the final outcome is determined by the activities of the winner – and amateur tennis is a Loser’s Game – the final outcome is determined by the activities of the loser. The two games are, in their fundamental characteristic, not at all the same. They are opposites.\n\nAmateur games are different. Amateur tennis — likely the level you and I play at — is a loser’s game. The winner is the person who makes the fewest mistakes and lets the other person beat themselves. If you keep the ball in play long enough, your opponent will make a mistake. In effect, amateurs win because their opponent makes more mistakes than they do.\n\nOrdinary people win at games they are not skilled in by letting their opponents beat themselves.\n\n> … if you choose to win at tennis – as opposed to having a good time – the strategy for winning is to avoid mistakes. The way to avoid mistakes is to be conservative and keep the ball in play, letting the other fellow have plenty of room in which to blunder his way to defeat, because he, being an amateur will play a losing game and not know it.\n\nWhile the amateur can’t _consistently_ hit winners, they want to because they think that’s the path toward victory. However, playing this way increases the odds they lose.\n\nWhen amateurs play a Winner’s game, they force shots with a low probability of success and a high probability of error. While they might hit the occasional winner, the ratio between winning and losing shots is heavily skewed toward losers.\n\nIn a sense, amateurs convince themselves they are professionals, but professionals never persuade themselves they are amateurs.\n\nProfessionals know they are not playing the same game as amateurs.\n\nThe takeaway is obvious: If you are within your [circle of competence](https://fs.blog/circle-of-competence/), go for the win. If you are not, avoid stupidity.\n\n## **Investors Bet on Someone Else’s Game**\n\nThis reminds me of a story. Warren Buffett used to convene a group of people called the _Buffett Group_.\n\nAt one such meeting, Benjamin Graham, Buffett’s mentor, gave them all a quiz.\n\nI spent hours searching for this reference from _Benjamin Graham on Value Investing: Lessons from the Dean of Wall Street_.\n\n> “He gave us a quiz,” Buffett said, “A true-false quiz. And there were all these guys who were very smart. He told us ahead of time that half were true and half were false. There were 20 questions. Most of us got less than 10 right. If we’d marked every one true or every one false, we would have gotten 10 right.”\n> \n> Graham made up the deceptively simple historical puzzler himself, Buffett explained. “It was to illustrate a point, that the smart fellow kind of rigs the game. It was 1968, when all this phoney accounting was going on. You’d think you could profit from it by riding along on the coattails, but (the quiz) was to illustrate that if you tried to play the other guy’s game, it was not easy to do.\n> \n> “Roy Tolles got the highest score, I remember that,” Buffett chuckled. “We had a great time. We decided to keep doing it.”\n\n## **Avoiding Stupidity is Easier Than Seeking Brilliance**\n\nMost of us are amateurs, but we refuse to use the winning strategy for amateurs: Avoid Errors. Instead, we try to be brilliant.\n\nThink of the know-nothing investor. The amateur strategy is to buy an index fund every month for 30-40 years. This strategy of average performance for an above-averag",

In this post, we explore how to develop the right mindset for improving your intelligence._\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nCarol Dweck studies human motivation. She spends her days diving into why people succeed (or don’t) and what’s within our control to foster success. Her theory of the two mindsets and the difference they make in outcomes is incredibly powerful.\n\nAs she describes it: “My work bridges developmental psychology, social psychology, and personality psychology, and examines the self-conceptions (or mindsets) people use to structure the self and guide their behavior. My research looks at the origins of these mindsets, their role in motivation and self-regulation, and their impact on achievement and interpersonal processes.”\n\nHer inquiry into our beliefs is synthesized in [Mindset: The New Psychology of Success](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0345472322/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0345472322&linkCode=as2&tag=farnamstreet-20&linkId=ZYKJHPHELN46AOWM). The book takes us on a journey into how our conscious and unconscious thoughts affect us and how something as simple as wording can have a powerful impact on our ability to improve.\n\nDweck’s work shows the power of our most basic beliefs. Whether conscious or subconscious, they strongly “affect what we want and whether we succeed in getting it.” Much of what we think we understand of our personality comes from our “mindset.” This both propels us and prevents us from fulfilling our potential.\n\nIn [Mindset: The New Psychology of Success](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0345472322/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0345472322&linkCode=as2&tag=farnamstreet-20&linkId=ZYKJHPHELN46AOWM), Dweck writes:\n\n> What are the consequences of thinking that your intelligence or personality is something you can develop, as opposed to something that is a fixed, deep-seated trait?\n\n## The Two Mindsets\n\n![Carol Dweck Two Mindsets](https://fs.blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Carol-Dweck-Two-Mindsets.jpg)\n\nYour view of yourself can determine everything. If you believe that your qualities are unchangeable — the fixed mindset — you will want to prove yourself correct over and over rather than learning from your mistakes.\n\nIn [Mindset](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0345472322/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0345472322&linkCode=as2&tag=farnamstreet-20&linkId=ZYKJHPHELN46AOWM), Dweck writes:\n\n> If you have only a certain amount of intelligence, a certain personality, and a certain moral character— well, then you’d better prove that you have a healthy dose of them. It simply wouldn’t do to look or feel deficient in these most basic characteristics.\n> \n> \\[…\\]\n> \n> I’ve seen so many people with this one consuming goal of proving themselves— in the classroom, in their careers, and in their relationships. Every situation calls for a confirmation of their intelligence, personality, or character. Every situation is evaluated: Will I succeed or fail? Will I look smart or dumb? Will I be accepted or rejected? Will I feel like a winner or a loser?\n\nThese things are culturally desirable. We value intelligence, personality, and character. It’s normal to want this. But …\n\nIn [Mindset](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0345472322/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0345472322&linkCode=as2&tag=farnamstreet-20&linkId=ZYKJHPHELN46AOWM), Dweck writes:\n\n> There’s another mindset in which these traits are not simply a hand you’re dealt and have to live with, always trying to convince yourself and others that you have a royal flush when you’re secretly worried it’s a pair of tens. In this mindset, the hand you’re dealt is just the starting point for development. This growth mindset is based on the belief that your basic qualities are things you can cultivate through your efforts.\n\nChanging our beliefs can have a powerful impact. The growth mindset creates a powerful passion for learning. “Why waste time proving over and over how great you are,” Dweck writes, “when you could be getting better?”\n\n> Why hide deficiencies instead of overcoming them? Why look for friends or partners who will just shore up your self-esteem instead of ones who will also challenge you to grow? And why seek out the tried and true, instead of experiences that will stretch you? **The passion for stretching yourself and sticking to it, even (or especially) when it’s not going well, is the hallmark of the growth mindset. This is the mindset that allows people to thrive during some of the most challenging times in their lives.**\n\n## Putting it into Practice\n\nOur ideas about risk and effort come from our mindset. Some people realize the value of challenging themselves, they want to put in the effort to learn and grow, a great example of this is [The Buffett Formula](http",

One of the best questions you can ask is how we can make our mental processes work better.\n\n[**Charlie Munger**](https://fs.blog/charlie-munger/) says that “developing the habit of mastering the multiple models which underlie reality is the best thing you can do.”\n\nThose models are [mental models](https://fs.blog/mental-models/).\n\nMental Models fall into a few categories, two of which are: (1) ones that help us simulate time (and predict the future) and better understand how the world works (e.g. understanding a useful idea  autocatalysis), and (2) ones that help us better understand how our mental processes lead us astray (e.g., availability bias).\n\nWhen our mental models line up with reality, they help us avoid problems. However, they also cause problems when they don’t line up with reality as we think something that isn’t true.\n\nIn Peter Bevelin’s [Seeking Wisdom](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1578644283/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=farnamstreet-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=1578644283&linkId=59873ec50dd9e1256db78220ffa165af), he highlights Munger talking about autocatalysis:\n\n> If you get a certain kind of process going in chemistry, it speeds up on its own. So you get this marvellous boost in what you’re trying to do that runs on and on. Now, the laws of physics are such that it doesn’t run on forever. But it runs on for a goodly while. So you get a huge boost. You accomplish A – and, all of a sudden, you’re getting A + B + C for awhile.\n\nHe continues telling us how this idea can be applied:\n\n> Disney is an amazing example of autocatalysis … They had those movies in the can. They owned the copyright. And just as Coke could prosper when refrigeration came, when the videocassette was invented, Disney didn’t have to invent anything or do anything except take the thing out of the can and stick it on the cassette.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nThis leads us to an interesting problem. The world is always changing, so which models should we prioritize learning?\n\nHow we [prioritize, our learning](https://fs.blog/2013/08/choose-your-next-book/) has implications beyond the day-to-day. Often we focus on things that change quickly. We chase the latest study, the latest findings, the most recent best-sellers. We do this to keep up-to-date with the latest-and-greatest.\n\nDespite our intentions, learning in this way fails to account for cumulative knowledge. Instead, we consume all of our time [keeping up to date](https://fs.blog/2012/10/the-red-queen-effect/).\n\nIf we are prioritize learning, we should focus on things that change slowly.\n\n> The models that come from hard science and engineering are the most reliable models on this Earth. And engineering quality control – at least the guts of it that matters to you and me and people who are not professional engineers – is very much based on the elementary mathematics of Fermat and Pascal: It costs so much and you get so much less likelihood of it breaking if you spend this much…\n> \n> And, of course, the engineering idea of a backup system is a very powerful idea. The engineering idea of breakpoints – that’s a very powerful model, too. The notion of a critical mass – that comes out of physics – is a very powerful model.\n\nAfter we learn a model, we have to make it useful. We have to integrate it into our existing knowledge.\n\nOur world is multi-dimensional and our problems are complicated. Most problems cannot be solved using one model alone. The more models we have, the better able we are to solve problems.\n\nBut if we don’t have the models, we become the proverbial man with a hammer. To the man with a hammer, everything looks like a nail. If you only have one model, you will fit whatever problem you face to the model you have. If you have more than one model; however, you can look at the problem from a variety of perspectives and increase the odds you come to a better solution.\n\n“Since no single discipline has all the answers,” Peter Bevelin writes in [Seeking Wisdom](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1578644283/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=farnamstreet-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=1578644283&linkId=59873ec50dd9e1256db78220ffa165af), “we need to understand and use the big ideas from all the important disciplines: Mathematics, physics, chemistry, engineering, biology, psychology, and rank and use them in order of reliability.”\n\nCharles Munger illustrates the importance of this:\n\n> Suppose you want to be good at declarer play in contract bridge. Well, you know the contract – you know what you have to achieve. And you can count up the sure winners you have by laying down your high cards and your invincible trumps.\n> \n> But if you’re a trick or two short, how are you going to get the",

In the case of Munger, it’s clearly a combination of unusual genetics and an unusual approach to learning and life.\n\nThere’s almost no limit to the amount one could learn from studying the Munger mind, so let’s at least start with a rundown of some of his best ideas.\n\n## Avoiding Stupidity\n\n_“Knowing what you don’t know is more useful than being brilliant.”_  \n_“Acknowledging what you don’t know is the dawning of wisdom.”_\n\nIdentify [your circle of competence](https://fs.blog/circle-of-competence/) and use your knowledge, when possible, to stay away from things you don’t understand. There are no points for difficulty at work or in life.  In fact, one of the key lessons is that [avoiding stupidity is easier than seeking brilliance](https://fs.blog/avoiding-stupidity/).\n\nOf course, this principle relates to another of Munger’s sayings: “People are trying to be smart—all I am trying to do is not to be idiotic, but it’s harder than most people think.”\n\nAnd this reminds me of perhaps my favorite Mungerism of all time, the very quote that sits right beside my desk:\n\n_“It is remarkable how much long-term advantage people like us have gotten by trying to be consistently not stupid, instead of trying to be very intelligent.”_\n\n## Advantageous Divergence\n\n_“Mimicking the herd invites regression to the mean.”_\n\nIf you do what everyone else does, you’re going to get the same results that everyone else gets.\n\nIf you want to move away from average, you must diverge. You must be different. And if you want to outperform others, you must be correct.\n\nAdvantageous divergence is doing something different and being correct.\n\n## Know When to Fold ’Em\n\n_“Life, in part, is like a poker game, wherein you have to learn to quit sometimes when holding a much-loved hand—you must learn to handle mistakes and new facts that change the odds.”_\n\nMistakes are nothing more than an opportunity to learn.\n\n## False Models\n\nEchoing Einstein, who said that “Not everything that counts can be counted, and not everything that can be counted counts,” Munger said this about his and Buffett’s shift to acquiring high-quality businesses for Berkshire Hathaway:\n\n_“Once we’d gotten over the hurdle of recognizing that a thing could be a bargain based on quantitative measures that would have horrified Graham, we started thinking about better businesses.”_\n\n## Being Lazy\n\n_“Sit on your ass. You’re paying less to brokers, you’re listening to less nonsense, and if it works, the tax system gives you an extra one, two, or three percentage points per annum.”_\n\nTime is a friend to a good business and the enemy of a poor business. As [Seneca said, “Time discovers truth.”](https://fs.blog/physics-relationships/)\n\n## Investing Is a Perimutuel System\n\n“You’re looking for a mispriced gamble,” says Munger. “That’s what investing is. And you have to know enough to know whether the gamble is mispriced. That’s value investing.”  At another time, he added: “You should remember that good ideas are rare— when the odds are greatly in your favor, bet heavily.”\n\n## Focus\n\nWhen asked about his success, Munger says, “I succeeded because I have a long attention span.”\n\n[Thinking requires focus.](https://fs.blog/how-to-think/) It’s hard to become an expert when you fragment your time and dabble in things.\n\nLong attention spans allow for a [deep understanding of subjects](https://fs.blog/2015/08/how-to-think/).

They tend to vastly underestimate the role of circumstance, luck, the nature of completion, and the effects of scale, among other things; falling prey to the many delusions described by **Phil Rosenzweig** in his _incredibly_ important book, [_The Halo Effect_](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1476784035/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=farnamstreet-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=1476784035&linkId=2b306cc79a5602c517670e45f50bd195).\n\nThe main problem Rosenzweig describes in the book is that attributes we tend to think _cause_ great performance (culture, leadership, etc.) are often just things that are _attributed_ to companies we already know are high-performing. There’s a Halo around everything they do.\n\nHow many current high-fliers would ever be described as having a bad culture, or bad leadership? It would be nonsense to say it. Thus, we run into a recursiveness problem. High performing companies have a great culture, and great culture is defined as the attributes that cause high performance.\n\nIn other words, when you ask someone if Apple has a great corporate culture, they will tell you it does. (And it’s an extremely successful company, so of course it does.)\n\nBut when we try to pinpoint _which aspects_ of Apple’s culture make it more successful than its peers, and which would be predictive of success at other companies, we run into a difficult problem.\n\nThe Halo Effect tells us that we will find a lot of false positives. The attributes we think are causal of _success_ are the same ones we often deem causal of _failure_ when company performance deteriorates. This is the [strategy paradox](https://fs.blog/2012/04/a-primer-on-strategy/).\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n[_Plain Talk_](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0471155144/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=farnamstreet-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0471155144&linkId=d993eafeb39b661bd04174878fe3986b), by **Ken Iverson**, is a memoir of his time running the steel company Nucor. Despite the warning, above this book deserves your attention for a few reasons:\n\n*   Nucor was extremely successful, for a long period, in an industry that provided huge headwinds. There are no magic pills to being successful in steel. It’s generally an awful business.\n*   The company did some very unusual things that we see in few other companies, even successful ones.\n*   The book was recommended by a very smart friend who runs a very successful business of his own, using similar principles.\n*   The author/CEO, Iverson, seems honest about the fact that many of his prescriptions are not new or different. The book is not presented as a panacea.\n*   It’s generally good to study outlier success or failure.\n\n## A Peculiar Kind of Success\n\nUnder Iverson, Nucor was an unusual sort of steel company compared to the Carnegie-esque behemoths of the past.\n\nSome of its attributes remind us of companies like [Berkshire Hathaway](https://fs.blog/2014/05/berkshire-hathaway-success/), but Nucor did it very differently. There were a few acquisitions. The company was totally focused on steel. Iverson describes some of the peculiarities in the opening of the book (this was written in 1998):\n\n> *   Our 7,000 employees are the best paid workers in the industry, yet Nucor has the lowest labor cost per ton of steel produced\n> *   Nucor is a Fortune 500 company with sales in excess of 3.6 billion, yet we have a total of just 22 people working at our corporate headquarters, and just four layers of management from the CEO to the front-line workers.\n> *   Nucor operates in a “rust belt” industry that lost one out of two jobs over a 25-year time span, yet Nucor has never laid off an employee or shut down a facility for lack of work, nor have we lost money in any business quarter for more than thirty consecutive years.\n\nThat is, of course, a very interesting outcome. Most steel companies were struggling mightily when Nucor came up. Bethlehem Steel almost went bankrupt in the late 70s. (They eventually [did](http://www.ncsociology.org/torchmagazine/v872/haas.html).) Foreign competition, rising input costs, rising labor costs, commoditization…steel is about as bad a business as you could invent. Yet in Iverson’s 30+ year reign, Nucor compounded its per-share earnings at a rate of about 17% per annum. There must have been something going on here — [he sounds like an outsider](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1422162672/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=farnamstreet-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=1422162672&linkId=0a1793d00b0bf49e75acebb2749911d4).\n\nLet’s focus on a few things that were particularly unusual.\n\n## Extreme Decentralization\n\nNucor believed (and to my knowledge, still believes) strongly in decentralization.

      "content": "\nOne of the strangest things about being human is that we can’t trust our own memories of what we were thinking. Not because we forget but rather because our brains actively edit the past to make us look better and smarter.\n\nThis wouldn’t matter much except that, for most people, your career is a series of decisions compounded over time. When you make one that turns out well, your brain quietly edits the story to make it seem like you knew what you were doing all along. And when you make a one that goes sideways, your brain adds in doubts and thinking you never actually had. The result of this process is that you don’t really know what you actually thought at the time.\n\nThis helps explain something puzzling: why smart people keep making the same mistakes.\n\n## Organizations Don’t Help\n\nOrganizations don’t really help. They treat decision-making ability as if it were fixed, like height. Either you have good judgment, or you don’t. This is strange, given that we improve at nearly everything we practice with feedback. So why don’t we do this with decisions?\n\nThe answer reveals something interesting about organizations: they don’t actually try to help people make better decisions. Instead, they try to identify people who already make good ones.\n\nSo, if organizations are not going to teach you about your blindspots when making decisions, you’ll have to teach yourself.\n\nEveryone has blindspots; the best way to discover yours is to keep a decision journal.\n\n## What is a Decision Journal?\n\nYou can think of a decision journal as quality control for our thinking — something like what we’d find in a manufacturing plant or a restaurant.\n\nThe strangest thing about most decisions is that [we often don’t know what we think until we try to write it down](https://fs.blog/how-to-think/). While we’d like to think we fully understand the problem before we make a big decision, that’s mostly not the case.\n\nSomething surprising happens when you have to [explain it on paper](https://fs.blog/writing-to-think/): you discover that what seemed like crystal-clear thoughts in your head are now murky and messy.\n\nA decision journal is really a mirror – one that shows you your thinking before your brain has a chance to polish it. The key is looking in this mirror before you act, not after.\n\n## A Decision Journal Template\n\nThe key question is what information to include in your decision journal. And you will have to use a bit of trial and error to figure this out.\n\nHere’s the template we use at FS.\n\n[![Decision Journal](https://fs.blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Decision-Journal.png)](https://fs.blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/decision-journal_draft3.pdf)\n\nClick for PDF\n\nWhenever you’re making a consequential decision, either individually or as part of a group, you take a moment and write down:\n\n1.  The situation or context\n2.  The problem statement or frame\n3.  The variables that govern the situation\n4.  The complications or complexity as you see it\n5.  Alternatives that were seriously considered and why they were not chosen (think: [the work required to have an opinion](https://fs.blog/the-work-required-to-have-an-opinion/))\n6.  A paragraph explaining the range of outcomes\n7.  A paragraph explaining what you expect to happen and the reasoning and actual probabilities you assign to each projected outcome (The degree of confidence matters, a lot.)\n8.  The time of day you’re making the decision and how you feel physically and mentally (If you’re tired, for example, write it down.)\n\nYou have to make this part your own. I’ve seen others include:\n\n*   What’s the primary thesis\n*   What is the expected outcome(s)\n*   What are the second and third-order consequences\n*   What is the worst-case scenario and why that’s ok\n*   What is the potential upside beyond the core thesis\n*   What emotions am I experiencing\n*   What is the opportunity cost (by doing this what am I not doing)\n*   What unique advantages or insights do I have in this situation\n*   Who is the best person to make this decision\n*   What does this look like in 5 weeks, 5 months, 5 years?\n\n## An Example Decision\n\nPerhaps an example will help illustrate. Here’s [a real decision](https://s3.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com/fsmisc/Example-Decision-FS-Decision-Journal.pdf) that I made using the FS decision journal template.\n\n## Tips on Using a Decision Journal\n\nHere are some tips to remember as you implement your decision journal.\n\nYour decision journal can be tailored to the situation and context. Specific decisions might include trade-offs, second-order effects, weighting criteria, or other relevant factors. These examples are only to get you started.\n\nWe can’t improve our thinking if we can’t see it. Don’t spend too much time on the brief and obvious insights. Often our first thoughts [represent the thinking of someone else](https://fs.blog/how-to-think/) and not our own thinking.\n\nAny decision you’re journaling is inherently complex and may involve non-linear systems.

These ideas — sometimes consciously and sometimes unconsciously tossed around in our head — combine into something new. This is part of the reason that creativity and innovation are hard. You can’t just pick up a single book or thread of knowledge and have it deliver results.\n\nThis beautiful Steve Jobs quote [sums it up nicely](https://fs.blog/2014/08/steve-jobs-on-creativity/).\n\n> “Creativity is just connecting things. When you ask creative people how they did something, they feel a little guilty because they didn’t really do it, they just saw something. It seemed obvious to them after a while.”\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nIn 1945 Jacques S. Hadamard surveyed mathematicians to determine their mental processes at work by posing a series of questions to them and later published his results in [_An Essay on the Psychology of Invention in the Mathematical Field_](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1406764191/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=farnamstreet-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=1406764191&linkId=a5edb8c306ab34e268ce14c8a324853d).\n\n> It would be very helpful for the purpose of psychological investigation to know what internal or mental images, what kind of “internal words” mathematicians make use of; whether they are motor, auditory, visual, or mixed, depending on the subject which they are studying.\n> \n> Especially in research thought, do the mental pictures or internal words present themselves in the full consciousness or in the fringe-consciousness …?\n\nEinstein’s response to the French mathematician, found in his [_Ideas and Opinions_](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0517884402/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=farnamstreet-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0517884402&linkId=db2e8518dccdddec0f1ac6d9536ae5a6), shows the physicist’s mind at work and the value of “combinatory play.”\n\n> My Dear Colleague:\n> \n> In the following, I am trying to answer in brief your questions as well as I am able. I am not satisfied myself with those answers and I am willing to answer more questions if you believe this could be of any advantage for the very interesting and difficult work you have undertaken.\n> \n> (A) The words or the language, as they are written or spoken, do not seem to play any role in my mechanism of thought. The psychical entities which seem to serve as elements in thought are certain signs and more or less clear images which can be “voluntarily” reproduced and combined.\n> \n> There is, of course, a certain connection between those elements and relevant logical concepts. It is also clear that the desire to arrive finally at logically connected concepts is the emotional basis of this rather vague play with the above-mentioned elements. But taken from a psychological viewpoint, this combinatory play seems to be the essential feature in productive thought — before there is any connection with logical construction in words or other kinds of signs which can be communicated to others.\n> \n> (B) The above-mentioned elements are, in my case, of visual and some of muscular type. Conventional words or other signs have to be sought for laboriously only in a secondary stage, when the mentioned associative play is sufficiently established and can be reproduced at will.\n> \n> (C) According to what has been said, the play with the mentioned elements is aimed to be analogous to certain logical connections one is searching for.\n> \n> (D) Visual and motor. In a stage when words intervene at all, they are, in my case, purely auditive, but they interfere only in a secondary stage, as already mentioned.\n> \n> (E) It seems to me that what you call full consciousness is a limit case which can never be fully accomplished. This seems to me connected with the fact called the narrowness of consciousness (Enge des Bewusstseins).\n> \n> Remark: Professor Max Wertheimer has tried to investigate the distinction between mere associating or combining of reproducible elements and between understanding (organisches Begreifen); I cannot judge how far his psychological analysis catches the essential point.\n",

However, I was a New Yorker for a whole year in 1930– 31 while attending advertising classes in Columbia’s School of Business. Actually I am a southerner, from Mississippi, the nation’s most backward state. Ramifications include Walter H. Page, who, unluckily for me, is no longer connected with Doubleday-Page, which is no longer Doubleday-Page, even. I have a B.A. (’ 29) from the University of Wisconsin, where I majored in English without a care in the world. For the last eighteen months I was languishing in my own office in a radio station in Jackson, Miss., writing continuities, dramas, mule feed advertisements, santa claus talks, and life insurance playlets; now I have given that up.\n> \n> As to what I might do for you— I have seen an untoward amount of picture galleries and 15¢ movies lately, and could review them with my old prosperous detachment, I think; in fact, I recently coined a general word for Matisse’s pictures after seeing his latest at the Marie Harriman: concubineapple. That shows you how my mind works—quick, and away from the point. I read simply voraciously, and can drum up an opinion afterwards.\n> \n> Since I have bought an India print, and a large number of phonograph records from a Mr. Nussbaum who picks them up, and a Cezanne Bathers one inch long (that shows you I read e. e. cummings I hope), I am anxious to have an apartment, not to mention a small portable phonograph. How I would like to work for you! A little paragraph each morning— a little paragraph each night, if you can’t hire me from daylight to dark, although I would work like a slave.

If there is such a volume in the camp library, will you ask Mrs. Tyson to let you look up a sonnet of Shakespeare’s in which the line occurs Lilies that fester smell far worse than weeds…\n> \n> I think of you, and always pleasantly, but I am going to take the White Cat out and beat his bottom hard, six times for every time you are impertinent. Do you react to that?…\n> \n> Half-wit, I will conclude. **Things to worry about:**\n> \n> Worry about courage  \n> Worry about cleanliness  \n> Worry about efficiency  \n> Worry about horsemanship\n> \n> **Things not to worry about:**  \n> Don’t worry about popular opinion  \n> Don’t worry about dolls  \n> Don’t worry about the past  \n> Don’t worry about the future  \n> Don’t worry about growing up  \n> Don’t worry about anybody getting ahead of you  \n> Don’t worry about triumph  \n> Don’t worry about failure unless it comes through your own fault  \n> Don’t worry about mosquitoes  \n> Don’t worry about flies  \n> Don’t worry about insects in general  \n> Don’t worry about parents  \n> Don’t worry about boys  \n> Don’t worry about disappointments  \n> Don’t worry about pleasures  \n> Don’t worry about satisfactions\n> \n> **Things to think about:**  \n> What am I really aiming at?  \n> How good am I really in comparison to my contemporaries in regard to:  \n> (a) Scholarship  \n> (b) Do I really understand about people and am I able to get along with them?  \n> (c) Am I trying to make my body a useful intrument or am I neglecting it?\n> \n> With dearest love,\n\nSounds like a timeless list, except, of course, for horsemanship.\n",

His key learning insight: complexity and jargon often mask a lack of understanding.\n\n**Feynman’s learning technique comprises four key steps:**\n\n1.  Select a concept and map your knowledge\n2.  Teach it to a 12-year-old\n3.  Review and Refine\n4.  Test and Archive\n\nLet’s delve deeper into these steps.\n\n![](https://fs.blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/FeynmanTechnique.jpg)\n\nFeynman’s secret lay in understanding the true essence of a concept rather than merely knowing its name, leading to his remarkable achievements. This learning technique can be applied universally, irrespective of the subject.\n\n> The person who says he knows what he thinks but cannot express it usually does not know what he thinks.\n> \n> Mortimer Adler\n\n## Step 1: Select a concept and map your knowledge\n\nStart with a blank page. Write everything you know about your chosen topic, using a different color pen for new information as you learn. This creates a visual map of your growing understanding.\n\n## Step 2: Explain it to a 12-year-old\n\nOnce you feel confident you understand it, write down your idea in words that a child would understand. You haven’t grasped it fully if you can’t explain it simply.\n\nWriting things down may sound simplistic, but it’s anything but. Writing things down helps in a lot of ways. First, it encourages [better thinking](https://fs.blog/how-to-think/). Second, you can organize your thoughts. Third, [clear writing reveals gaps in understanding](https://fs.blog/why-write/); it’s hard to ignore mistakes when you see them so clearly on the page. Fourth, writing will allow you to review and refine your work.\n\n> Anyone can make a subject complicated but only someone who understands can make it simple.\n\n## Step 3: Review and Refine\n\nReading and reviewing your work will not only expose the areas where you don’t understand things as well as you think you do, it offers other benefits.\n\nReviewing your work (often, see step 4) allows you to improve your understanding, measure your progress, and develop new ideas.\n\nWhen you find weak spots, return to the source material. Study those sections until you can explain them simply. When you realize your understanding has improved and the section could be improved, re-write it.\n\n## **Step 4: Test and Archive**\n\nTest your understanding by teaching someone else. Do not use your notes, but refer to them if necessary.\n\nOnce satisfied, archive your simple explanation in a learning binder for periodic review.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nThe Feynman Technique is the foundation of [accelerated learning and lasting retention](https://fs.blog/reading/).\n",

If only it were that easy. It’s [mentally hard to come to an opinion](https://fs.blog/2013/04/the-work-required-to-have-an-opinion/) and even harder to give up that attachment and admit that we were wrong. That’s one reason Henry Singleton opted for [flexibility instead of predetermined plans](https://fs.blog/2013/01/henry-singleton-on-strategic-planning-stay-flexible/).\n\nF. Scott Fitzgerald famously wrote: “The test of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposing ideas in mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function. One should, for example, be able to see that things are hopeless yet be determined to make them otherwise.”\n\nThe idea is to live in the middle of ideas, believing in them enough to take action but not enough so they become too big of an anchor when something better comes along. More than acknowledging the uncertainty of beliefs you need to embrace it. Keats called this ability “[negative capability](https://fs.blog/2014/08/john-keats-quality-man-of-achievement-negative-capability/).” Roger Martin argues that [successful thinking](https://fs.blog/2014/07/changing-how-we-think/) involves integrating several different ideas while maintaining the ability to act. It is through the exploration of these opposing ideas, or uncertainty if you will, that we come to better outcomes.\n\nI came across this passage in Dani Shapiro’s [Still Writing](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0802121403/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=farnamstreet-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0802121403&linkId=074bd93fb14a7b4f3ad63ed520717c1b) that speaks to the necessity of failure and uncertainty in the creative process.\n\n> When writers who are just starting out ask me when it gets easier, my answer is never. It never gets easier. I don’t want to scare them, so I rarely say more than that, but the truth is that, if anything, it gets harder. The writing life isn’t just filled with predictable uncertainties but with the awareness that we are always starting over again. That everything we ever write will be flawed. We may have written one book, or many, but all we know — if we know anything at all — is how to write the book we’re writing. All novels are failures. Perfection itself would be a failure. All we can hope is that we will fail better. That we won’t succumb to fear of the unknown. That we will not fall prey to the easy enchantments of repeating what may have worked in the past. I try to remember that the job — as well as the plight, and the unexpected joy — of the artist is to embrace uncertainty, to be sharpened and honed by it. To be birthed by it. Each time we come to the end of a piece of work, we have failed as we have leapt — spectacularly, brazenly — into the unknown.\n\nShapiro further highlights the parallels between writing and the broader parallels with the creative life:\n\n> The writing life requires courage, patience, persistence, empathy, openness, and the ability to deal with rejection. It requires the willingness to be alone with oneself. To be gentle with oneself. To look at the world without blinders on. To observe and withstand what one sees. To be disciplined, and at the same time, take risks. To be willing to fail—not just once, but again and again, over the course of a lifetime.\n> \n> \\[…\\]  \n> The page is your mirror. What happens inside you is reflected back. You come face-to-face with your own resistance, lack of balance, self-loathing, and insatiable ego—and also with your singular vision, guts, and fortitude.No matter what you’ve achieved the day before, you begin each day at the bottom of the mountain. Isn’t this true for most of us?\n\n[Still Writing](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0802121403/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=farnamstreet-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0802121403&linkId=074bd93fb14a7b4f3ad63ed520717c1b) will help you discover the mindset for a creative life.\n",

      "content": "\n_Nothing will change your future trajectory like your habits._\n\nWe all have goals, big or small, things we want to achieve within a certain time frame. Maybe you want to make a million dollars by the time you turn 30. Or to lose 20 pounds before summer. Or to write a book in the next six months. When we begin to chase a vague concept (success, wealth, health, happiness), making a tangible goal is often the first step.\n\nHabits are algorithms operating in the background that power our lives. Good habits help us reach our goals more effectively and efficiently. Bad ones makes things harder or prevent success entirely. Habits powerfully influence our automatic behavior.\n\n> “First forget inspiration.  \n> Habit is more dependable.  \n> Habit will sustain you whether you’re inspired or not.  \n> Habit is persistence in practice.”\n> \n> — Octavia Butler\n\n**The difference between habits and goals is not semantic.** Each requires different forms of action. For example:\n\nLet’s say you want to read more books. You could set the goal to read 50 books by the end of the year, or you could create a habit and decide to always carry a book with you.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n## The problems with goals\n\nLet’s go over the problems with only having goals.\n\n**First off, goals have an endpoint.** This is why many people revert to their previous state after achieving a certain goal. People run marathons, then stop exercising altogether. Or they make a certain amount of money, then fall into debt soon after. Others reach a goal weight, only to spoil their progress by overeating to celebrate.\n\nHabits avoid these pitfalls because they continue indefinitely.\n\n**Second, goals rely on factors that we do not always have control over**.\n\nIt’s an unavoidable fact that reaching a goal is not always possible, regardless of effort. An injury might derail a fitness goal. An unexpected expense might sabotage a financial goal. And family issues might impede a creative-output goal.\n\nWhen we set a goal, we’re attempting to transform what is usually a heuristic process into an algorithmic one. Habits are better algorithms, and therefore more reliable in terms of getting us to where we want to go.\n\n**The third problem with goals is keeping** **a goal in mind and using it to direct our actions requires a lot of thinking and effort to evaluate different options**.\n\nPresented with a new situation, we have to figure out the course of action best suited to achieving a goal. With habits, we already know what to do by default.\n\nDuring times when other parts of our lives require additional attention, it can be easy to push off attaining our goals to another day. For example, the goal of saving money requires self-discipline each time we make a purchase. Meanwhile, the habit of putting $50 in a savings account every week requires less effort as a practical action.\n\nHabits, not goals, make otherwise difficult things easy.\n\n**Finally, goals can make us complacent or reckless.**\n\nSometimes our brains can confuse goal setting with achievement because setting the goal feels like an end in itself. This effect is more pronounced when people inform others of their goals. Furthermore, unrealistic goals can lead to dangerous or unethical behavior because we make compromises to meet our stated objective.\n\n> “Habit is the intersection of knowledge (what to do), skill (how to do), and desire (want to do).”\n> \n> — Stephen Covey\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n## The benefits of habits\n\nOnce formed, habits operate automatically. Habits take otherwise difficult tasks—like saving money—and make them easy in practice.\n\nThe purpose of a well-crafted set of habits is to ensure that we reach our goals with incremental steps.\n\nAs the saying goes, the way to eat an elephant is one bite at a time. The benefits of a systematic approach to life include:\n\n**Habits can mean we overshoot our goals.**\n\nConsider a person who has the goal to write a novel. They decide to write 500 words a day, so it should take 200 days. Writing 500 words generally doesn’t require an enormous amount of effort assuming interest in and knowledge of the topic, and even on the busiest, most stressful days, the person gets it done. However, on some days, that smaller step leads to their writing 1000 or more words. As a result, they finish the book in much less time.\n\nOn the contrary, setting “write a book in four months” as a goal would have been intimidating on final word count alone.\n\n**Habits are easy to complete.**\n\nAs Charles Duhigg wrote in _The Power of Habit_,\n\n> “_Habits are powerful, but delicate. They can emerge outside our consciousness or can be deliberately designed. They often occur without our permission but can be reshaped by fiddling with their parts. They shape our lives far more than we realize—they are so strong, in fact, that they cause our brains to cling to them at the exclusion of all else, including common sense_.”\n\nOnce we develop a habit, our brains actually change to make the behavior easier to complete. After about 30 days",

One of his most salient prescriptions comes from the life of Charles Darwin:\n\n> It is my opinion, as a certified biography nut, that Charles Robert Darwin would have ranked in the middle of the Harvard School graduating class if 1986. Yet he is now famous in the history of science. This is precisely the type of example you should learn nothing from if bent on minimizing your results from your own endowment.\n> \n> Darwin’s result was due in large measure to his working method, which violated all my rules for misery and particularly emphasized a backward twist in that he always gave priority attention to evidence tending to disconfirm whatever cherished and hard-won theory he already had. In contrast, most people early achieve and later intensify a tendency to process new and disconfirming information so that any original conclusion remains intact. They become people of whom Philip Wylie observed: “You couldn’t squeeze a dime between what they already know and what they will never learn.”\n> \n> The life of Darwin demonstrates how a turtle may outrun a hare, aided by extreme objectivity, which helps the objective person end up like the only player without a blindfold in a game of Pin the Tail on the Donkey.\n\n![Charles Darwin (Via Wikipedia)](https://www.farnamstreetblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Portrait_of_Charles_Darwin._Wellcome_M0010103-245x300.jpg)\n\nThe great Harvard biologist E.O. Wilson agreed. In his book, [Letters to a Young Scientist](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0871403854/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0871403854&linkCode=as2&tag=farnamstreet-20&linkId=QPNOL5KHF6LHERZK), Wilson [argued that](https://www.farnamstreetblog.com/2015/12/e-o-wilson-how-science-works/) Darwin would have probably scored in the 130 range on a standard IQ test. And yet there he is, buried next to the calculus-inventing genius Isaac Newton in Westminster Abbey. (As Munger often notes.)\n\n\\[quote\\]I had, also, during many years, followed a golden rule, namely, that whenever a published fact, a new observation or thought came across me, which was opposed to my general results, to make a memorandum of it without fail and at once; for I had found by experience that such facts and thoughts were far more apt to escape from memory than favorable ones.\\[/quote\\]\n\nWhat can we learn from the working and thinking habits of Darwin?\n\n## Extreme Focus Combined with Attentive Energy\n\nThe first clue comes from his own autobiography. Darwin was a _hoover_ of information related to a topic he was interested in. After describing some of his specific areas of study while aboard the H.M.S. Beagle, Darwin concludes in his [Autobiography](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0393310698/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0393310698&linkCode=as2&tag=farnamstreet-20&linkId=PHJYXUPXRIKU3NUO):\n\n> The above various special studies were, however, of no importance compared with the habit of energetic industry and of concentrated attention to whatever I was engaged in, which I then acquired. Everything about which I thought or read was made to bear directly on what I had seen and was likely to see; and this habit of mind was continued during the five years of the voyage. I feel sure that it was this training which has enabled me to do whatever I have done in science.\n\nThis habit of pure and attentive focus to the task at hand is, of course, echoed in many of our favorite thinkers, from [Sherlock Holmes](https://www.farnamstreetblog.com/2012/12/the-power-of-concentration/), to [E.O. Wilson](https://www.farnamstreetblog.com/2015/12/e-o-wilson-how-science-works/), [Feynman](https://www.farnamstreetblog.com/2015/12/deviations-from-the-beaten-track/), Einstein, and others. Munger himself remarked that _“I did not succeed in life by intelligence. I succeeded because I have a long attention span.”_\n\nIn Darwin’s quest, there was almost nothing relevant to his task at hand — the problem of understanding the origin and development of species — which might have escaped his attention. He had an extremely broad antenna. Says David Quammen in his fabulous [The Reluctant Mr. Darwin](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0195077180/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0195077180&linkCode=as2&tag=farnamstreet-20&linkId=5TGHUFC2IWH2ST2C):\n\n> One of Darwin’s great strengths as a scientist was also, in some ways, a disadvantage: his extraordinary breadth of curiosity.

Was my eventual success primarily a result of talent, luck, hard work, or an accidental just-right balance of each? All I know for sure is that I pursued a conscious strategy of managing my opportunities in a way that would make it easier for luck to find me.\n\nSimilar to the [10 things I took away from reading The Everything Store](https://fs.blog/2013/10/the-everything-store/), here are 10 things I took away ‘from the Adams book.’\n\n## 1\\. Do Creative Work First\n\nIn the morning, he is a creator, in the afternoon he’s a copier. Mindless tasks go later in the day. This is the single biggest change you can make to improve your odds of success.\n\n> The way I approach the problem of multiple priorities is by focusing on just one main metric: my energy. I make choices that maximize my personal energy because that makes it easier to manage all of the other priorities.\n> \n> One of the most important tricks for maximizing your productivity involves matching your mental state to the task.\n\nMark McGuinness [writes](http://www.farnamstreetblog.com/2013/05/the-single-most-important-change-you-can-make-in-your-working-habits/) the same thing in Manage Your Day-to-Day.\n\n## 2\\. On Expecting People to Be Reasonable\n\nThis sounds like you or someone you know. Trust me.\n\n> If your view of the world is that people use reason for their important decisions, you are setting yourself up for a life of frustration and confusion. You’ll find yourself continually debating people and never winning except in your own mind. Few things are as destructive and limiting as a worldview that assumes people are mostly rational.\n\n## 3\\. The Most Important Form of Selfishness\n\nWe’re taught that being selfish is bad, but it all depends on how you look at it. Being selfish can be good.\n\n> The most important form of selfishness involves spending time on your fitness, eating right, pursuing your career, and still spending quality time with your family and friends.\n\nYou can’t be generous to others if you’re not in a good place. Adams argues that once your needs are met, you can focus on the needs of others.\n\n## 4\\. Withholding Praise is Immoral\n\nWhile I’ve long thought that organizational feedback systems were broken, I had never really thought about it in this way before.\n\n> Children are accustomed to a continual stream of criticisms and praise, but adults can go weeks without a compliment while enduring criticism both at work and at home. Adults are starved for a kind word. When you understand the power of honest praise (as opposed to bullshitting, flattery, and sucking up), you realize that withholding it borders on immoral. If you see something that impresses you, a decent respect to humanity insists you voice your praise.\n\n## 5\\. Don’t Read the News for Truth\n\nAs a long-time subscriber to the physical newspaper, I cut the cord in July 2013. I’ll have more to say on this later, but I like reading other people’s reasoning for reading or not reading papers. Some people argue we’re heading back to [Yellow Journalism](https://fs.blog/2012/10/trust-me-im-lying-why-sites-like-gawker-manipulate-you/), a time when papers try to get attention however they can. Others argue [it’s a waste of time](https://fs.blog/2012/05/noise-and-signal-nassim-taleb/). Adams argues that it broadens his exposure.\n\n> I don’t read the news to find truth, as that would be a foolish waste of time. I read the news to broaden my exposure to new topics and patterns that make my brain more efficient in general and to enjoy myself, because learning interesting things increases my energy and makes me feel optimistic.\n\n## 6\\. Fake it Till you Make it\n\nAnother manifestation of what we think influences what we do but what we do influences what we think. This is, at its core, the finding of the Stanford prison experiment.\n\n> \\[W\\]e are designed to become in reality however we act. We fake it until it becomes real. Our core personality doesn’t change, but we quickly adopt the mannerisms and skills associated with our new status and position.\n\nIn addition to this, we see ourselves as part of a new group and accordingly identify ourselves “with the other members and take on some of the characteristics of the group.” This is one of the reasons why sometimes people change w",

In the book, Bennett addresses one of our oldest questions: **how can we make the best use of our lives? How can we make the best use of our time?**\n\nBennett begins by reflecting on our counterintuitive tendency to value money over time. This is a topic which has been discussed as far back as the Stoics, and more recently by the financial independence movement. He writes:\n\n> Newspapers are full of articles explaining how to live on such-and-such a sum…but I have never seen an essay ‘how to live on 24 hours a day.’ Yet it has been said that time is money. That proverb understates the case. Time is a great deal more than money. If you have time, you can obtain money-usually. But…you cannot buy yourself a minute more time.\n\nNext, he urges people to realize what a wonder it is that our daily allocation of time appears anew each time we wake:\n\n> The supply of time is truly a daily miracle. You wake up in the morning and lo! your purse is magically filled with 24 hours of the unmanufactured tissue of the universe of your life! It is yours.\n\nBennett’s original audience consisted of working people of slim means, used to structuring their lives around money. For this reason, he uses money as a metaphor for time, to make the abstract concepts seem more real:\n\n> You cannot draw on the future. Impossible to get into debt! You can only waste the passing moment. You cannot waste tomorrow, it is kept from you.\n> \n> You have to live on this 24 hours of time. Out of it you have to spin health, pleasure, money, content, respect and the evolution of your immortal soul. It’s right use…is a matter of the highest urgency.\n\nPerhaps one of the starkest and most memorable lines in the book is this:\n\n> We shall never have more time. We have, and have always had, all the time there is.\n\nBennett strongly encourages his readers to pursue their dreams, even if they fail. When we listen to [the regrets of the elderly and dying](https://www.farnamstreetblog.com/2013/06/karl-pillemer-interview-no-2/), they invariably lament on what they neglected to do, not what they did. It is, however, the trying which matters, the journey which fulfills us:\n\n> A man may desire to go to Mecca… He fares forth…he may probably never reach Mecca; he may drown before he reaches Port Said; he may perish ingloriously on the cost of the Red Sea; his desire may remain eternally frustrated. Unfulfilled aspiration may always trouble him. But he will not be tormented in the same way as the man who…never leaves Brixton.\n\nThere is no magic bullet, no secret way to find more time. We see the desire to find one today, as people chase time management techniques which promise to free up more hours in the day:\n\n> I have found no such wonderful secret. Nor do I expect to find it, nor do I expect anyone else to find it. It is undiscovered… there is no easy way, no royal road. The path to Mecca is extremely hard and stony and the worst part is that you never get there after all.\n\nThis could be discouraging but it’s not. Bennett encourages us to focus on how we can use our time to improve ourselves, stating that it is never too late:\n\n> You can turn over a new leaf every hour if you choose.\n\nThe idea that you can reinvent yourself each hour of the day is liberating. We get stuck in ruts and tell ourselves that we cannot change because we are too old, too young, too poor, too tied down. These are only excuses. They absolve us from responsibility. Bennett reminds us that just as money can be spent on anything, so can time. And, as Seneca reminded us, most of us [fail to understand time](https://www.farnamstreetblog.com/2017/03/seneca-on-the-shortness-of-time/) until it’s too late.\n\nBennett foreshadows modern research on habit change and personal development, which urges people to start small:\n\n> Beware of undertaking too much at the start. Be content with quite a little. Allow for accidents. Allow for human nature, especially your own… a glorious failure is better than a petty success.\n\nHaving set the stage, Bennett begins to discuss exactly how much time his audience has available to them. It is a simple fact that most of us believe we work for far more hours than we do – the average person’s estimate of their work week is out by 20 hours. Most workers are only productive for 3 hours a day. (the rest is spent on social media, gossiping and so on.) You can indeed [get more done by working less](https://www.farnamstreetblog.com/2017/04/get-more-done-by-working-less/).\n\n> You say your day is already full",

      "content": "\nWhy is it that some people seem to be able to read a book once and remember every detail of it for life, while others struggle to recall even the title a few days after putting down a book?\n\nThe answer is simple but not easy.\n\nIt’s not what they read. It’s _how_ they read. Good reading habits not only help you read _more_ but help you read _better_.\n\n> “I cannot remember the books I have read any more than the meals I have eaten; even so, they have made me.”\n> \n> — Ralph Waldo Emerson\n\n## Active Vs. Passive Readers\n\nPassive readers forget things almost as quickly as they read them. Active readers, on the other hand, retain the bulk of what they read. Another difference between these two types of readers is how the quantity of reading affects them differently. Passive readers who read a lot are not much further ahead than passive readers who read a little. If you’re an active reader, however, things are different.\n\nThe more that active readers read, the better they get. They develop a latticework of [mental models](https://fs.blog/mental-models/) to hang ideas on, further increasing retention. Active readers learn to differentiate good arguments and structures from bad ones. Active readers [make better decisions](https://fs.blog/smart-decisions/) because they know how to [get the world to do the bulk of the work](https://fs.blog/2016/02/joseph-tussman/) for them. Active readers avoid problems. Active readers have another advantage: **The more they read the faster they read.**\n\nThink back to the books you studied in school. Despite the passage of time, most us remember a lot about them. Even if the details are fuzzy, we can doubtless recall the basic plots, main characters, notable themes, and motifs. Why? Well for one, we didn’t just passively read those books. We actively read them complete with class discussions where we took turns reading parts aloud, acted out scenes, or maybe even watched film adaptations. No matter how long it has been since we set foot in a classroom, we all probably remember Animal Farm.\n\n## Effective Reading Habits\n\nHaving a deliberate strategy to get better at anything we spend a lot of time on is a sensible approach. While we might spend a lot of time reading and consuming information, few of us consciously improve the effectiveness of our reading.\n\nTo get the most out of each book we read **it is vital to have a plan for recording, reflecting on, and putting into action the conclusions we draw from the information we consume**. In this article, we will show you how to get maximum benefit from every single page you read.\n\nFirst, let’s clear up some common misconceptions about reading. Here’s what I know:\n\n*   **Quality matters more than quantity.** If you read just one book a week but fully appreciate and absorb it, you’ll be far better off than someone who skims through half the library without paying much attention.\n*   [**Speedreading is bullshit.**](https://medium.com/the-mission/speed-reading-is-bullshit-f5acbee7f59e) The only way to read faster is to actually read more.\n*   **Book summary services miss the point**. A lot of companies charge ridiculous prices for access to summaries written by some 22-year-old with exactly zero experience in the subject matter of the book. This misses the point of not only reading but how we learn.\n*   **Fancy apps and tools are not needed.** A notebook, index cards, and a pen will do just fine. (For those of you wanting a simple and searchable online tool to help, Evernote is the answer.)\n*   **Don’t read stuff we find boring.** \n*   **Finishing the book is optional.** You should start a lot of books and only finish a few of them.\n\n> “Every time I read a great book I felt I was reading a kind of map, a treasure map, and the treasure I was being directed to was in actual fact myself. But each map was incomplete, and I would only locate the treasure if I read all the books, and so the process of finding my best self was an endless quest. And books themselves seemed to reflect this idea. Which is why the plot of every book ever can be boiled down to ‘someone is looking for something’.”\n> \n> — Matt Haig, Reasons to Stay Alive\n\nA lot of success in reading boils down to preparation. What you do before you read matters way more than you think.\n\n## **Filter Your Reading**\n\nThere are no rules when it comes to choosing books. We don’t have to read bestsellers, or classics, or books everyone else raves about. In fact, there’s an advantage to be gained from reading things other people are not reading. This isn’t school and there are no required reading lists. Focus on some combination of books that: (1) stand the test of time; (2) pique your interest; or (3) resonate with your current situation.\n\nThe more interesting and relevant we find a book, the more likely we are to remember its contents in the future.\n\nFor older books or those that have been translated, check which version is considered to be the best. For example, the [Hayes translation of Marcu",

Thompson was 22 years old when he wrote this letter to his friend Hume Logan in response to a request for life advice.\n\nThompson’s letter, found in _[Letters of Note](https://amzn.to/49FwHuC)_, offers some of the most thoughtful and profound advice I’ve ever encountered for those of us feeling a little lost.\n\n> April 22, 1958  \n> 57 Perry Street  \n> New York City\n> \n> Dear Hume,\n> \n> You ask advice: ah, what a very human and very dangerous thing to do! For to give advice to a man who asks what to do with his life implies something very close to egomania. To presume to point a man to the right and ultimate goal— to point with a trembling finger in the RIGHT direction is something only a fool would take upon himself.\n> \n> I am not a fool, but I respect your sincerity in asking my advice. I ask you though, in listening to what I say, to remember that all advice can only be a product of the man who gives it. What is truth to one may be disaster to another. I do not see life through your eyes, nor you through mine. If I were to attempt to give you specific advice, it would be too much like the blind leading the blind.\n> \n> _“To be, or not to be: that is the question: Whether ’tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, or to take arms against a sea of troubles … ” (Shakespeare)_\n> \n> And indeed, that IS the question: whether to float with the tide, or to swim for a goal. It is a choice we must all make consciously or unconsciously at one time in our lives. So few people understand this! Think of any decision you’ve ever made which had a bearing on your future: I may be wrong, but I don’t see how it could have been anything but a choice however indirect— between the two things I’ve mentioned: the floating or the swimming.\n> \n> But why not float if you have no goal? That is another question. It is unquestionably better to enjoy the floating than to swim in uncertainty. So how does a man find a goal? Not a castle in the stars, but a real and tangible thing. How can a man be sure he’s not after the “big rock candy mountain,” the enticing sugar-candy goal that has little taste and no substance?\n> \n> The answer— and, in a sense, the tragedy of life— is that we seek to understand the goal and not the man. We set up a goal which demands of us certain things: and we do these things. We adjust to the demands of a concept which CANNOT be valid. When you were young, let us say that you wanted to be a fireman. I feel reasonably safe in saying that you no longer want to be a fireman. Why? Because your perspective has changed. It’s not the fireman who has changed, but you. Every man is the sum total of his reactions to experience. As your experiences differ and multiply, you become a different man, and hence your perspective changes. This goes on and on. Every reaction is a learning process; every significant experience alters your perspective.\n> \n> So it would seem foolish, would it not, to adjust our lives to the demands of a goal we see from a different angle every day? How could we ever hope to accomplish anything other than galloping neurosis?\n> \n> The answer, then, must not deal with goals at all, or not with tangible goals, anyway. It would take reams of paper to develop this subject to fulfillment. God only knows how many books have been written on “the meaning of man” and that sort of thing, and god only knows how many people have pondered the subject.

This is the Innovator’s Dilemma long before the innovator’s dilemma.\n\nThe perspective of Richard Foster, the book’s author, is that there is a battle going on in the marketplace between innovators (or attackers) and defenders (who want to maintain their existing advantage).\n\nSome companies have more good years than bad years. What’s the secret behind their success? Foster argues it’s their willingness to cannibalize “their current products and processes just as they are the most lucrative and begin the search again, over and over.\n\n> It is about the inexorable and yet stealthy challenge of new technology and the economics of sub situation which force companies to behave like the mythical phoenix, a bird that periodically crashed to earth in order to rejuvenate itself.\n\nThe book isn’t about improving process but rather changing your mindset. This is the Attacker’s Advantage.\n\nHenry Ford understood this mindset. In [My Life and Work](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1545549117/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=farnamstreet-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=1545549117&linkId=74c0a048b55bc4abe7b6a76c3237ba0d), he wrote,\n\n> If to petrify is success, all one has to do is to humor the lazy side of the mind; but if to grow is success, then one must wake up anew every morning and keep awake all day. I saw great businesses become but the ghost of a name because someone thought they could be managed just as they were always managed, and though the management may have been most excellent in its day, its excellence consisted in its alertness to its day, and not in slavish following of its yesterdays. Life, as I see it, is not a location, but a journey. Even the man who most feels himself ‘settled’ is not settled—he is probably sagging back. Everything is in flux, and was meant to be. Life flows. We may live at the same number of the street, but it is never the same man who lives there.\n> \n> \\[…\\]\n> \n> It could almost be written down as a formula that when a man begins to think that he at last has found his method, he had better begin a most searching examination of himself to see whether some part of his brain has not gone to sleep.\n\nFoster recognizes that innovation is “born from individual greatness” but exists within the context of a marketplace where the S-curve dominates and questions such as “how much change is possible, when it will occur, and how much it will cost,” are critical factors.\n\nCompanies are often blindsided by change. Everything is profitable until it isn’t. But leading companies are supposed to have an advantage. Or, are “the advantages outweighed by other inherent disadvantages?” Foster argues this is the case.\n\n> The roots of this failure lie in the assumptions behind the key decisions that all companies have to make. Most of the managers of companies that enjoy transitory success assume that tomorrow will be more or less like today. That significant change is unlikely, is unpredictable, and in any case will come slowly. They have thus focused their efforts on making their operations ever more cost effective. While valuing innovation and espousing the latest theories on entrepreneurship, they still believe it is a highly personalized process that cannot be managed or planned to any significant extent. They believe that innovation is risky, more risky than defending their present business.\n\nSome companies make the opposite assumption. They assume tomorrow does not resemble today.\n\n> They have assumed that when change comes it will come swiftly. They believe that there are certain patterns of change which are predictable and subject to analysis. They have focused more on being in the right technologies at the right time, being able to protect their positions, and having the best people rather than on becoming ever more efficient in their current lines of business.

Jacobi often solved difficult problems by following a simple strategy: “_man muss_ immer umkehren” (or loosely translated, “invert, always invert.”)\n\n“\\[Jacobi\\] knew that it is in the nature of things that many hard problems are best solved when they are addressed backward,” Munger counsels.\n\nWhile Jacobi applied inversion mostly to mathematics, the model is one of the most powerful [mental models](https://fs.blog/mental-models/) in our toolkit.\n\nIt is not enough to think about difficult problems one way. You need to think about them forwards and backward. Inversion often forces you to uncover hidden beliefs about the problem you are trying to solve. “Indeed,” says Munger, “many problems can’t be solved forward.”\n\nLet’s take a look at some examples. Say you want to improve innovation in your organization. Thinking forward, you’d think about all of the things you could do to foster innovation. If you look at the problem by inversion, however, you’d think about all the things you could do that would discourage innovation. Ideally, you’d avoid those things. Sounds simple right? I bet your organization does some of those ‘stupid’ things today.\n\nAnother example, rather than think about what makes a good life, you can think about what prescriptions would ensure misery.\n\n## Avoiding stupidity is easier than seeking brilliance.\n\nWhile both thinking forward and thinking backward result in some action, you can think of them as _additive_ vs. _subtractive_.\n\nDespite our best intentions, thinking forward increases the odds that you’ll cause harm ([iatrogenics](https://fs.blog/2013/10/iatrogenics/)). Thinking backward, call it subtractive avoidance or inversion, is less likely to cause harm.\n\nInverting the problem won’t always solve it, but it will help you avoid trouble. You can think of it as the avoiding stupidity filter. It’s not sexy but it’s a very easy way to improve.\n\n**So what does this mean in practice?**\n\nSpending time thinking about the opposite of what you want doesn’t come naturally to most people. And yet many of the smartest people in history, have done this naturally.\n\nInversion helps improve understanding of the problem. By forcing you to do [the work necessary to have an opinion](https://fs.blog/2013/04/the-work-required-to-have-an-opinion/) you’re forced to consider different perspectives.\n\nIf you’re to take anything away from inversion let it be this: Spend less time trying to be brilliant and more time trying to avoid obvious stupidity. The kicker?

I love the physical act of having the books on the shelves to be looked at, admired, and remembered.\n\nWhen I was younger, I really enjoyed the library, and I still do. But I learned over time that for me to _own_ a book — intellectually — I needed to _own_ the damn book. I needed to have it close by for reference. I needed to be able to [write in i](https://fs.blog/reading-a-book-is-a-conversation/)t and take it down off the shelf and put it back on the shelf and take it down off the shelf and put it back on the — you get it.\n\nSo I built my [Anti-library](https://fs.blog/the-antilibrary/), and today, even after giving away hundreds of books, my shelves are stocked. I’ve probably read 1/4 of them. But I keep adding.\n\n## Reading Big Books\n\nLooking at my shelves recently, I saw a book I’d wanted to read for the longest time and, in fact, had started over the summer, stopping after about 150 pages to move on to more “immediate” reads. (All great books, most of which I enjoyed, but not _classics_.)\n\nIt was [_The Power Broker_](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0394720245/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0394720245&linkCode=as2&tag=farnamstreet-20&linkId=NGOVPLYVGCF5EMOY), by Robert Caro.\n\nIt’s a classic on power politics in New York in the early to middle 20th century, seen through the eyes of the brilliant and wicked Robert Moses. The glory and curse of the book, though, is that it’s a doorstopper. It runs at about 1,110 pages — dense ones. I think Caro said it came to about 700,000 words. (Which was down from his original finished draft of over a _million._) It’s well written, not a slog in any sense of the word, but even great books take time due to sheer volume.\n\nWhen you think about reading a book like that, even taking it off the shelf seems to generate anxiety. Let’s do the math: I’m a pretty good reader, I think I read in the neighborhood of 300 words per minute. It might be plus or minus 50 words, but my guess is that’s a close estimate for a text written in modern English prose.\n\nAt 300 words per minute, a 700,000-word text will take me 2,333 minutes, or about 39 hours to read. And there’s the issue: the brain doesn’t seem to like to get started on 39-hour projects it isn’t being paid to complete. The gap between where you are and completion is too large. Instead, we pick something shorter and easier. Still counts, right?\n\nI thought about all of the _other_ great works I wanted to get to in my lifetime. Caro has four (eventually five) books about LBJ that are masterpieces on 20th-century American politics.

The fictional letters, from John Graham, Head of the House of Graham & Company, to his son Pierrepont, a lazy college student offer timeless advice for anyone. The Letters were quite well known in the early 20th century. I’m not sure why they are not well known today, but they should be.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nWriting to his son, Pierrepont, at Harvard University, a Freshman, Graham offers advice on the education he is about to receive inside and outside of the classroom.\n\n> What we’re really sending you to Harvard for is to get a little of the education that’s so good and plenty there. When it’s passed around you don’t want to be bashful, but reach right out and take a big helping every time, for I want you to get your share. You’ll find that education’s about the only thing lying around loose in this world, and that it’s about the only thing a fellow can have as much of as he’s willing to haul away. Everything else is screwed down tight and the screw-driver lost.\n> \n> \\[…\\]\n> \n> Some men learn the value of money by not having any and starting out to pry a few dollars loose from the odd millions that are lying around; and some learn it by having fifty thousand or so left to them and starting out to spend it as if it were fifty thousand a year. Some men learn the value of truth by having to do business with liars; and some by going to Sunday School. Some men learn the cussedness of whiskey by having a drunken father; and some by having a good mother. Some men get an education from other men and newspapers and public libraries; and some get it from professors and parchments—it doesn’t make any special difference how you get a half-nelson on the right thing, just so you get it and freeze on to it.\n> \n> \\[…\\]\n> \n> The first thing that any education ought to give a man is character, and the second thing is education. That is where I’m a little skittish about this college business. I’m not starting in to preach to you, because I know a young fellow with the right sort of stuff in him preaches to himself harder than any one else can, and that he’s mighty often switched off the right path by having it pointed out to him in the wrong way.\n> \n> \\[…\\]\n> \n> There are two parts of a college education—the part that you get in the schoolroom from the professors, and the part that you get outside of it from the boys. That’s the really important part. For the first can only make you a scholar, while the second can make you a man.\n> \n> Education’s a good deal like eating—a fellow can’t always tell which particular thing did him good, but he can usually tell which one did him harm.\n> \n> \\[…\\]\n> \n> Does a College education pay? … You bet it pays. Anything that trains a boy to think and to think quick pays; anything that teaches a boy to get the answer before the other fellow gets through biting the pencil, pays.\n> \n> College doesn’t make fools; it develops them.

      "content": "\nConsider two contrasting daily schedules.\n\nNovelist Haruki Murakami starts writing at 4am and writes for about 5-6 hours straight. Then he runs or swims, and reads or listens to music before a 9pm bedtime. He’s known for his strict discipline.\n\nEntrepreneur Gary Vaynerchuk, in contrast, starts at 6am and splits his day into tiny slots, mostly meetings, some as short as 3 minutes. Between meetings he makes calls. Any free moment, he posts on social media. His day is a never-ending circle of managing, organizing, instructing, deciding, planning, and advising.\n\nThe numerous articles about the routines of successful people miss the point. Waking early doesn’t make you a novelist. Segmenting your day doesn’t make you an entrepreneur.\n\nThe lesson isn’t what time to set your alarm, which journalling prompt to use, or how long to wait before drinking your coffee. The lesson is that different work requires different schedules.\n\n> How we spend our days is, of course, how we spend our lives. What we do with this hour, and that one, is what we are doing. A schedule defends from chaos and whim. It is a net for catching days. It is a scaffolding on which a worker can stand and labor with both hands at sections of time.\n> \n> Annie Dillard, The Writing Life\n\nMurakami and Vaynerchuk’s contrasting days illustrate maker and manager schedules.\n\nPaul Graham of Y Combinator first described this concept in a 2009 essay. From Graham’s distinction between makers and managers, we learn that doing creative work and overseeing others requires consideration of the way time is structured.\n\n## What’s the Difference?\n\nA manager’s day is sliced into tiny slots, each with a pre-determined purpose. The bulk of their time is spent gathering information and making decisions. A secretary may plan the schedule due to the volume of meetings, which further distances the manager from the headache of scheduling.\n\nManagers spend most of their time reacting and “putting out fires.” It’s an endless race from one fire to the next. Managers are always always behind, with barely a moment before the next thing.\n\nManagers don’t necessarily need the capacity for deep focus — they primarily need the ability to make fast, smart decisions. In a three-minute meeting, they have the potential to generate (or destroy) enormous value through their decisions and expertise.\n\nA maker’s schedule is different. It has long blocks for focusing on particular tasks, or entire days devoted to one activity. The more meetings, the less work gets done. Dividing a maker’s day into minutes would be tantamount to doing nothing.\n\nMakers need to do one thing really well.\n\nWhile meetings are the life of managers, they are the enemy of makers. While managers want them, makers want to avoid them. Paul Graham observes:\n\n> When you’re operating on the maker’s schedule, meetings are a disaster. A single meeting can blow a whole afternoon, by breaking it into two pieces each too small to do anything hard in. Plus you have to remember to go to the meeting. That’s no problem for someone on the manager’s schedule. There’s always something coming on the next hour; the only question is what. But when someone on the maker’s schedule has a meeting, they have to think about it.\n\nIt makes sense. The two work styles could not be more different.\n\nA manager’s job is to organize people and make decisions.\n\nAs Andrew Grove writes in _[High Output Management](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0679762884/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=farnamstreet-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0679762884&linkId=1af86e09dfefac3851ab36cdc0008e8a)_:\n\n> …a big part of a middle manager’s work is to supply information and know-how, and to impart a sense of the preferred method of handling things to the groups under his control and influence. A manager also makes and helps to make decisions. Both kinds of basic managerial tasks can only occur during face-to-face encounters, and therefore only during meetings. Thus, I will assert again that a meeting is nothing less than the _medium_ through which managerial work is performed. That means we should not be fighting their very existence, but rather using the time spent in them as efficiently as possible.\n\nA maker creates tangible value. Makers work alone or under a manager, possibly with others. “Maker” encompasses writers, artists, programmers, carpenters, chefs, biohackers, designers – anyone who designs, creates, serves, and thinks.\n\nMaking anything meaningful demands time, and the right schedule helps. The path of making something is the path of figuring it out. And no one likes to be interrupted when they are totally focused on figuring something out. Take a look at the quintessential maker schedule of the prolific (to say the least) writer Isaac Asimov, as described in his memoir:\n\n> I wake at five in the morning. I get to work as early as I can. I work as long as I can. I do this every day of the week, including holidays. I don’t take vacations ",

      "content": "\nThe 19th century German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer would have recognized the problem of clickbait.\n\nIn his essays, _On Authorship_ and _[On Reading](https://fs.blog/meditation-on-reading/)_, he identified two types of authors: those who write for the sake of the subject, and those who write for the sake of writing (and really, for the sake of making money).\n\nTheir motivations couldn’t be more different. The former write because they are curious and they want to figure something out. They’re like a detective, exploring a subject from all sides, trying to come to a deeper understanding. For them the process of writing is [how they figure out what they don’t know](https://fs.blog/why-write/) and how they come up with new ideas. The latter because they get paid by the word, not the insight. You can recognize the latter by how they stretch out half-baked thoughts “to the greatest possible length.” Their writing is evasive, “lacking in definiteness and clearness.”\n\nIf this sound familiar, it should. It’s the literary equivalent of clickbait – content created not to inform, but simply to capture eyeballs and sell ads. Our world is awash in this type of soul-sucking content. As Schopenhauer put it, writing for money is “at bottom, the ruin of literature. It is only the man who writes absolutely for the sake of the subject that writes anything worth writing.”\n\nThe more bad writing we tolerate, the more we get ([Gresham’s Law](https://fs.blog/mental-model-greshams-law/)). While people spend time on “worthless trash,” they leave “the works of great thinkers undisturbed.”\n\nNot all writing is worth reading. Just because someone can put words on a page doesn’t mean they are worth reading or add value.\n\n## The Raw Material Of the Mind\n\nSchopenhauer’s solution to clickbait is a form of [inversion](https://fs.blog/inversion/) — the best way to read better is to avoid reading junk. In his words, we should make it a rule to “never to read what is bad; for life is short, and both time and strength limited.”\n\nIf you think of your mind as a factory for producing insights, consider reading the raw material. Just as a factory needs high-quality raw materials to produce great products, so does your mind. Without great raw material, even the best factory grinds to a halt.\n\nIf you find yourself low on ideas, it’s a sign you’re reading the wrong things or need to read more.\n\n## Avoid Bad Writing\n\nTo read more great writing, you need to avoid a lot of bad writing.\n\nOne of the most underrated skills is knowing what not to read. This keeps you from wasting time on content designed to cheat the reader. Some warning signs are fairly easy to spot, while others are more subtle. If a headline is engineered to generate clicks rather than convey information, stay away. Likewise, if you land on a page with flashing ads and auto-playing videos, close the browser and move on. Beware of writing that promises easy answers to hard problems. Any article that claims to reveal the secret to anything is almost certainly peddling simplistic thinking. Reality is messy and multi-faceted; writing that pretends otherwise is shallow or dishonest. Another warning sign you’re reading something with low information density is when it’s full of jargon or is evasive.\n\nEven some outwardly respectable sources can be trojan horses for mediocre writing.\n\nThe opportunity cost of consuming second-rate writing is higher than ever. In a world where more great writing is available than any human could read in a lifetime, it pays to be ruthless in filtering what you won’t read. Your attention is a precious resource; invest it wisely.\n\n## Unconventional Tips\n\nHere are a few tips to help you better curate your information diet.\n\n*   **[Avoid news](https://fs.blog/stop-reading-news/) and read old biographies.** Schopenhauer explains, “The best works come from the time when they had to write either for nothing or for very little pay.”\n*   **Regularly curate your social media feed.** Regularly reviewing who provides the raw material of your mind allows you to regularly upgrade your supplies.\n*   **Work on your own writing**. As your writing improves, not only will you learn to convey information effectively, but you’ll also develop an aversion to low-quality sources of information. After all, [writing is thinking](https://fs.blog/writing-to-think/).\n\nThe choice of what to read has never been more important.\n\nAs Schopenhauer warned, a diet of intellectual junk food will cause us to “sink deeper and deeper into the mire” of shallow, unoriginal thinking. But if we’re selective in what we read, we can find writing that elevates our minds.\n\nIn the end, the thoughts we consume determine the ones we produce.\n\n> One can never read too little of bad or too much of good books: bad books are intellectual poison; they destroy the mind.\n> \n> Schopenhauer\n",

What is important is knowing when you are approaching the perimeter.\n\nWithin your circle of competence, you operate with an advantage. As you approach the perimeter (the limitations of your knowledge), your advantage starts to reduce. As you cross the perimeter, not only does your advantage vanish, but it transfers to other people. Suddenly, you find yourself playing in an area where others have an edge.\n\nJust because you are good at something doesn’t mean you are good at everything.\n\nA Grandmaster in chess is at home on the chessboard, but those skills don’t translate into being competent in other areas of life, such as cooking in the kitchen. In fact, it’s often the case that extreme skills in one area create extreme weaknesses in others.\n\n> I want to think about things where I have an advantage over other people. I don’t want to play a game where people have an advantage over me. I don’t play in a game where other people are wise and I am stupid. I look for a game where I am wise and they are stupid. And believe me it works better. God bless our stupid competitors. They make us rich.\n> \n> Charlie Munger\n\nAs we cross the perimeter from what we know to what we don’t, confidence does not diminish as fast as competence. The biggest risk when operating outside of your circle of competence is what you don’t see.\n\nWhile most people are concerned with the _size_ of their circle, it’s a lot more important to know when you are approaching the _perimeter_.\n\n## Circle Of Competence\n\n> I’m no genius. I’m smart in spots—but I stay around those spots.\n> \n> Tom Watson Sr., Founder of IBM\n\nWarren Buffett [described](http://www.tilsonfunds.com/BuffettNotreDame.pdf) circle of competence using one of his former business managers, Rose Blumkin, a Russian immigrant with poor English who built the largest furniture store in Nebraska:\n\n> I couldn’t have given her $200 million worth of Berkshire Hathaway stock when I bought the business because she doesn’t understand stock. She understands cash. She understands furniture. She understands real estate. She doesn’t understand stocks, so she doesn’t have anything to do with them. If you deal with Mrs. B in what I would call her circle of competence… She is going to buy 5,000 end tables this afternoon (if the price is right). She is going to buy 20 different carpets in odd lots, and everything else like that \\[snaps fingers\\] because she understands carpet. She wouldn’t buy 100 shares of General Motors if it was at 50 cents a share.\n\nIt did not hurt Mrs. B to have such a narrow area of competence. In fact, one could argue the opposite. Her rigid devotion to that area allowed her to focus. Only by focusing on one thing could she overcome her handicaps and achieve such extreme success.\n\n[Charlie Munger](https://fs.blog/charlie-munger/) applies the concept to life in general. He sought to answer the essential question: Where should we devote our limited time to achieve the most success?\n\n> You have to figure out what your own aptitudes are. If you play games where other people have the aptitudes and you don’t, you’re going to lose. And that’s as close to certain as any prediction that you can make. You have to figure out where you’ve got an edge. And you’ve got to play within your own circle of competence.\n> \n> If you want to be the best tennis player in the world, you may start out trying and soon find out that it’s hopeless—that other people blow right by you. However, if you want to become the best plumbing contractor in Bemidji, that is probably doable by two-thirds of you. It takes a will. It takes the intelligence. But after a while, you’d gradually know all about the plumbing business in Bemidji and master the art. That is an attainable objective, given enough discipline. And people who could never win a chess tournament or stand in center court in a respectable tennis tournament can rise quite high in life by slowly developing a circle of competence—which results partly from what they were born with and partly from what they slowly develop through work.\n\nIt becomes easier to stay within your circle of competence when you focus on outcome over ego.\n\nWhen asked why Berkshire Hathaway hasn’t invested in pharmaceuticals, Charlie Munger responded:[1](#footnote-1)\n\n> By and large, we haven’t invested in pharmaceuticals because we’ve got no edge. I don’t know enough about biology and medicine and chemistry to have any edge in guessing which new pharmaceutical attempt is likely to succeed and other people who know those things, not that they have perfect knowledge, but it’s wa",

Like a map, mental models highlight key information while ignoring irrelevant details. They’re tools for compressing complexity into manageable chunks.\n\nMental models help us understand the world. For example, velocity shows that both speed and direction matter. Reciprocity reveals how being positive and taking initiative gets the world to do most of the work for you. Margin of Safety reminds us that things don’t always go as planned. Relativity exposes our blind spots and shows how a different perspective can reveal new information. These are just a few examples.\n\n> If you want to be a good thinker, you must develop a mind that can jump the jurisdictional boundaries. You don’t have to know it all. Just take in the best big ideas from all these disciplines. And it’s not that hard to do.\n> \n> Charlie Munger\n\n## The Big Ideas From The Big Disciplines\n\nThis page summarizes the big ideas to help you make better decisions, avoid problems, and spot opportunities others miss.\n\n*   [General Thinking Tools](#general_thinking_concepts)\n*   [Physics, Chemistry, and Biology](#physics_and_chemistry)\n*   [Systems](#systems)\n*   [Numeracy](#numeracy)\n*   [Microeconomics](#microeconomics)\n*   [Military and War](#military_and_war)\n*   [Human Nature and Judgment](#human_nature_and_judgment)\n\n[![](https://fs.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Tgmm-1024x458.png)](https://fs.blog/tgmm)\n\n## General Thinking Tools\n\n**[The Map is Not the Territory](https://fs.blog/map-and-territory/)**\n\nThe map is not the territory reminds us that our mental models of the world are not the same as the world itself. It cautions against confusing our abstractions and representations with the complex, ever-­shifting reality they aim to describe.\n\nIt is dangerous to mistake the map for the territory. Consider the person with an outstanding résumé who checks all the boxes on paper but can’t do the job.\n\nUpdating our maps is a difficult process of reconciling what we want to be true with what is true.\n\nIn many areas of life, we are offered maps by other people. We are reliant on the maps provided by experts, pundits, and teachers. In these cases, the best we can do is to choose our mapmakers wisely and to seek out those who are rigorous, transparent, and open to revision.\n\nUltimately, the map/territory distinction invites us to engage with the world as it is, not just as we imagine it. And remember, when you don’t make the map, choose your cartographer wisely.\n\n**[Circle of Competence](https://fs.blog/circle-of-competence/)**\n\nThe first rule of competition is that you are more likely to win if you play where you have an advantage. Playing to your advantage requires a firm understanding of what you know and don’t know.\n\nYour circle of competence is your personal sphere of expertise, where your knowledge and skills are concentrated. It’s the domain where you have a deep understanding, where your judgments are reliable, and your decisions are sound. \n\nThe size of your circle isn’t as important as knowing the boundaries. The wise person knows the limits of their knowledge and can confidently say, “This falls within my circle,” or “This is outside my area of expertise.” \n\nWhile operating within your circle of competence is a recipe for confidence and effectiveness, venturing outside your circle of competence is a recipe for trouble. You’re like a sailor navigating unfamiliar waters without a map, at the mercy of currents and storms you don’t fully understand. This isn’t to say that you should never venture outside your circle. Learning new things, gaining new skills, and mastering new domains is one of the most beautiful things about life. \n\nCelebrate your expertise, but also acknowledge your limitations.\n\n**[First Principles Thinking](https://fs.blog/first-principles/)**\n\nFirst principles thinking is the art of breaking down complex problems into their fundamental truths. It’s a way of thinking that goes beyond the surface and allows us to see things from a new perspective.\n\nThinking in first principles allows us to identify the root causes, strip away the layers of complexity, and focus on the most effective solutions. Reasoning from first principles allows us to step outside the way things have always been done and instead see what is possible.\n\nFirst principles thinking is not easy. It requires a willingness to challenge the status quo. This is why it’s often the domain of rebels and disrupters who believe there must be a better way. It’s the thinking of those willing to start from scratch and build from the ground up.\n\nIn a world focused on incremental improvement, first principles thinking offers a competitive advantage because almost no one does it.\n\n**[Thought Experiment](https://fs.blog/thought-experiment/)**\n\nThought experiments are the sandbox of the mind, the place where we can play with ide",

I am so excited to get to talk to you today and ask you a whole bunch of questions that I have on my mind.\n\n**Naval:** Thank you for having me. I’m excited to be here. I’ve been a long time fan of your work.\n\n**Shane:** Thank you. Let’s get started with something simple. Can you tell me a little bit about what you do?\n\n**Naval:** It’s actually not that simple. I have a hard time saying what I do. My day job is that I am CEO of AngelList, which is a company that I started almost seven years ago now. AngelList is sort of this platform for startups in the tech industry and we help entrepreneurs raise money. We help entrepreneurs recruit talent into their startups and we also help people find jobs into startups. Now recently we acquired Product Hunt, so we also help companies launch to customers.\n\nIt’s basically a one-stop shop for the early stage tech ecosystem. Whether you are raising money or you’re investing money, we’re the largest online platform for that. Whether you’re recruiting talent or whether you’re being recruited, we’re the largest online platform for startup recruiting. \n\nWhether you’re looking for a new product to try out or whether you’re looking for customers for your product, we’re also the largest online product platform for launching that.\n\nIt’s sort of become this bigger thing and that’s my day job. I’m also involved in a bunch of other things. I’m an investor, personally in about 200 companies. Advisor to a bunch. I’m on a bunch of boards. I occasionally blog and tweet. I’m also a small partner in a cryptocurrency fund because I’m really into these coins, like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Zcash, and so forth. I’m always cooking up something new. I always have a bunch of side projects that I bring in.\n\n_Press cmd⌘ + p or ctrl + p to print this transcript. Sharing with one or two friends is ok. Posting on the internet is not._\n\n**Shane:** How do you keep track of that all? What does your typical day look like?\n\n**Naval:** That’s the good part. I don’t have a typical day, nor do I want a typical day. If there is a typical day, I’m usually inside my office at AngelList, but I’m basically just operating mostly on email or phone or meetings or squirreled up at home. There are days where I just work completely from home. There are days that I don’t work. I’m actually even trying to get rid of this concept of having to be in a specific place at a specific time. All I care about is am I doing what I want to do and am I being productive and am I happy. I really want to break away from this idea of 40 hour weeks, or 60 hour weeks, or 80 hour weeks, or 9-to-5, or roles, or jobs, or identities. It just all feels like a straitjacket.\n\n**Shane:** You’re one of the most voracious readers I know. You’ve called yourself a conscious bookworm, and you’ve read a t",

Infants learn that pushing an object will cause it to move, crying will cause people to give them attention, and bumping into something will cause pain. As we get older, this understanding becomes more complex. Many people love to talk about the causes of significant events in their lives (if I hadn’t missed the bus that day I would never have met my partner! or if I hadn’t taken that class in college I would never have discovered my passion and got my job!) Likewise, when something bad happens we have a tendency to look for somewhere to pin the blame.\n\nThe mental model of proximate vs root causes is a more advanced version of this reasoning, which involves looking beyond what appears to be the cause and finding the real cause. As a higher form of understanding, it is useful for creative and innovative thinking. It can also help us to solve problems, rather than relying on band-aid solutions.\n\nMuch of our understanding of cause and effect comes from Isaac Newton. His work examined how forces lead to motion and other effects. Newton’s laws explain how a body remains stationary unless a force acts upon it. From this, we can take a cause to be whatever causes something to happen.\n\nFor example, someone might ask: Why did I lose my job?\n\n*   **Proximate cause:** the company was experiencing financial difficulties and could not continue to pay all its employees.\n*   **Root cause:** I was not of particular value to the company and they could survive easily without me.\n\nThis can then be explored further: Why was I not of value to the company?\n\n*   **Ultimate cause:** I allowed my learning to stagnate and did not seek constant improvement. I continued doing the same as I had been for years which did not help the company progress.\n*   **Even further:** Newer employees were of more value because they had more up-to-date knowledge and could help the company progress.\n\nThis can then help us to find solutions: How can I prevent this from happening again?\n\n*   **Answer**: In future jobs, I can continually aim to learn more, keep to date with industry advancements, read new books on the topic and bring creative insights to my work. I will know this is working if I find myself receiving increasing amounts of responsibility and being promoted to higher roles.\n\nThis example illustrates the usefulness of this line of thinking. If our hypothetical person went with the proximate cause, they would walk away feeling nothing but annoyance at the company which fired them. By establishing the root causes, they can mitigate the risk of the same thing happening in the future.\n\nThere are a number of relevant factors which we must take into account when figuring out root causes. These are known as predisposing factors and can be used to prevent a future repeat of an unwanted occurrence.\n\nPredisposing factors tend to include:\n\n*   The location of the effect\n*   The exact nature of the effect\n*   The severity of the effect\n*   The time at which the effect occurs\n*   The level of vulnerability to the effect\n*   The cause of the effect\n*   The factors which prevented it from being more severe.\n\nLooking at proximate vs root causes is a form of abductive reasoning- a process used to unearth simple, probable explanations. We can use it in conjunction with philosophical razors (such as [Occam’s](https://www.farnamstreetblog.com/2017/05/mental-model-occams-razor/) and [Hanlon’s](https://www.farnamstreetblog.com/2017/04/mental-model-hanlons-razor/)) to make smart decisions and choices.\n\nIn [Root Cause Analysis](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0873897641/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=farnamstreet-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0873897641&linkId=87c59bab0ff2a025fa3f00d76f5ac0bf), Paul Wilson defines root causes as:\n\n> Root cause is that most basic reason for an undesirable condition or problem which, if eliminated or corrected, would have prevented it from existing or occurring.\n\nIn [Leviathan](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0140431950/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=farnamstreet-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0140431950&linkId=90ef1ad12dea1b5e9c7e816829f65e62), Chapter XI (1651) Thomas Hobbes wrote:\n\n> Ignorance of remote causes disposeth men to attribute all events to the causes immediate and instrumental: for these are all the causes they perceive…Anxiety for the future time disposeth men to inquire into the causes of things: because the knowledge of them maketh men the better able to order the present to their best advantage. Curiosity, or love of the knowledge of causes, draws a man from consideration of the effect to seek the cause; and again, the cause of that cause; till of necessity he must come to this thought at last that ",

Richard Feynman asked him what he was doing. Koichi responded: “studying the Coherence theory with some applications to the propagation of electromagnetic waves through turbulent atmosphere … a humble and down-to-earth type of problem.”\n\n> Dear Koichi,\n> \n> I was very happy to hear from you, and that you have such a position in the Research Laboratories. Unfortunately your letter made me unhappy for you seem to be truly sad. It seems that the influence of your teacher has been to give you a false idea of what are worthwhile problems. **The worthwhile problems are the ones you can really solve or help solve, the ones you can really contribute something to. A problem is grand in science if it lies before us unsolved and we see some way for us to make some headway into it. I would advise you to take even simpler, or as you say, humbler, problems until you find some you can really solve easily, no matter how trivial. You will get the pleasure of success, and of helping your fellow man, even if it is only to answer a question in the mind of a colleague less able than you. You must not take away from yourself these pleasures because you have some erroneous idea of what is worthwhile.**\n> \n> You met me at the peak of my career when I seemed to you to be concerned with problems close to the gods. But at the same time I had another Ph.D. Student (Albert Hibbs) whose thesis was on how it is that the winds build up waves blowing over water in the sea. I accepted him as a student because he came to me with the problem he wanted to solve. With you **I made a mistake, I gave you the problem instead of letting you find your own**; and left you with a wrong idea of what is interesting or pleasant or important to work on (namely those problems you see you may do something about). I am sorry, excuse me. I hope by this letter to correct it a little.\n> \n> I have worked on innumerable problems that you would call humble, but which I enjoyed and felt very good about because I sometimes could partially succeed. For example, experiments on the coefficient of friction on highly polished surfaces, to try to learn something about how friction worked (failure). Or, how elastic properties of crystals depend on the forces between the atoms in them, or how to make electroplated metal stick to plastic objects (like radio knobs). Or, how neutrons diffuse out of Uranium. Or, the reflection of electromagnetic waves from films coating glass. The development of shock waves in explosions. The design of a neutron counter. Why some elements capture electrons from the L-orbits, but not the K-orbits. General theory of how to fold paper to make a certain type of child’s toy (called flexagons). The energy levels in the light nuclei. The theory of turbulence (I have spent several years on it without success). Plus all the “grander” problems of quantum theory.\n> \n> **No problem is too small or too trivial if we can really do something about it.**\n> \n> You say you are a nameless man. You are not to your wife and to your child. You will not long remain so to your immediate colleagues if you can answer their simple questions when they come into your office. You are not nameless to me. Do not remain nameless to yourself – it is too sad a way to be. Know your place in the world and evaluate yourself fairly, not in terms of your naïve ideals of your own youth, nor in terms of what you erroneously imagine your teacher’s ideals are.\n> \n> Best of luck and happiness.\n> \n> Sincerely,\n> \n> Richard P.

This is called use second-order thinking.\n\nIt’s often easier to identify when people don’t adequately consider the second and subsequent-order impacts. For example, consider a country that, wanting to inspire regime change in another country, funds and provides weapons to a group of “moderate rebels.” Only it turns out that those moderate rebels will become powerful and then go to war with the sponsoring country for decades. Whoops.\n\n> Failing to consider second- and third-order consequences is the cause of a lot of painfully bad decisions, and it is especially deadly when the first inferior option confirms your own biases. Never seize on the first available option, no matter how good it seems, before you’ve asked questions and explored.\n> \n> Ray Dalio\n\nThe ability to think through problems to the second, third, and nth order—or what we will call second-order thinking for short—is a powerful thinking tool that not only solves problems but avoids them.\n\n![](https://fs.blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/second-order.png)\n\n## Second-Order Thinking\n\nIn his book, _[The Most Important Thing](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0231162847/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0231162847&linkCode=as2&tag=farnamstreet-20&linkId=IVJWRTJOAYFYASKD),_ [Howard Marks](https://fs.blog/knowledge-project-podcast/howard-marks/) explains the concept of second-order thinking, which he calls second-level thinking.\n\n> First-level thinking is simplistic and superficial, and just about everyone can do it (a bad sign for anything involving an attempt at superiority). All the first-level thinker needs is an opinion about the future, as in “The outlook for the company is favorable, meaning the stock will go up.” Second-level thinking is deep, complex and convoluted.\n\n**First-order thinking is fast and easy.** It happens when we look for something that only solves the immediate problem without considering the consequences. For example, you can think of this as I’m hungry, so let’s eat a chocolate bar.\n\n**Second-order thinking is more deliberate.** It is thinking in terms of interactions and time, understanding that despite our intentions our interventions [often cause harm](https://fs.blog/2013/10/iatrogenics/). Second order thinkers ask themselves the question “[And then what?](https://fs.blog/2015/12/garrett-hardin-three-filters/)” This means thinking about the consequences of repeatedly eating a chocolate bar when you are hungry and using that to inform your decision. If you do this you’re more likely to eat something healthy.\n\nFirst-level thinking looks similar. Everyone reaches the same conclusions. This is where things get interesting. The road to out-thinking people can’t come from first-order thinking. It must come from second-order thinking. Extraordinary performance comes from seeing things that other people can’t see.\n\n![Second order thinking graph](https://fs.blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/second_order_graph.png)\n\n## Improving Your Ability To Think\n\nHere are some ways to put second-order thinking into practice today.\n\n1.  Always ask yourself, “And then what?”\n2.  Think across time — What do the consequences look like in 10 minutes? 10 months? 10 Years?\n3.  Create templates like the second image above with 1st, 2nd, and 3rd order consequences. Identify your decision, think it through, and write down the consequences. If you review these regularly you’ll be able to help calibrate your thinking.\n4.  If you’re using this to think about business decisions, ask yourself how important parts of the ecosystem are likely to respond. How will employees deal with this? What will my competitors likely do? What about my suppliers? What about the regulators? Often, the answer will be little to no impact, but you want to understand the immediate and second-order consequences before you make the decision.\n\nA lot of extraordinary things in life are the result of things that are first-order negative, second order positive. So just because things look like they have no immediate payoff, doesn’t mean that’s the case. All it means is that you’ll have less competition if the second and third order consequences are positive because everyone who thinks at the first order won’t think things through.\n\nSecond-order thinking takes a lot of work. It’s not easy to think in terms of systems, interactions, and time. However, doing so is a smart way to separate yourself from the masses.\n",

You can spend your energy on what’s important or what’s not – but trying to do both only undermines only what’s important.\n\nLearning what to ignore is the key to focusing on what matters. This sounds simpler than it is.\n\nConsider Albert Einstein. Many believe his genius lay in his mathematical ability. But while he was certainly talented, those who knew him considered his mathematical skills relatively ordinary.\n\nSo how did someone with average mathematical ability become one of history’s greatest scientists?\n\nHis true gift was different – and often overlooked.\n\nEinstein had an extraordinary ability to cut through complexity and focus on what was essential. When others got lost in complicated details, he could zero in on what really mattered by ignoring the rest.\n\nAs physicist John Wheeler noted in his memoir about Einstein, his genius wasn’t in understanding more complex things than others – it was in recognizing the fundamental importance of simplicity.\n\n> Many a man in the street thinks of Einstein as a man who could only make headway in his work by dint of pages of complicated mathematics; the truth is the direct opposite. As Hilbert put it, “Every boy in the streets of our mathematical Gottingen understands more about four-dimensional geometry than Einstein. Yet, despite that, Einstein did the work and not the mathematicians.” Time and again, in the photoelectric effect, in relativity, in gravitation, the amateur grasped the simple point that had eluded the expert.\n\nIt would be easy to assume Einstein was born with this ability to simplify. But the truth is he deliberately cultivated it throughout his adult life.\n\n“I soon learned,” Einstein wrote, “to scent out what was able to lead to fundamentals and to turn aside from everything else, from the multitude of things that clutter up the mind.”\n\nWhere did Einstein acquire this ability to sift the essential from the non-essential?\n\n> In the view of many, the position of clerk of the Swiss patent office was no proper job at all, but it was the best job available to anyone with (Einstein’s) unpromising university record. He served in the Bern office for seven years, from June 23, 1902 to July 6, 1909. Every morning he faced his quote of patent applications. Those were the days when a patent application had to be accompanied by a working model. Over and above the applications and the models was the boss, a kind man, a strict man, a wise man. He gave strict instructions: explain very briefly, if possible in a single sentence, why the device will work or why it won’t; why the application should be granted or why it should be denied.\n> \n> Day after day Einstein had to distill the central lesson out of objects of the greatest variety that man has power to invent. Who knows a more marvelous way to acquire a sense of what physics is and how it works? It is no wonder that Einstein always delighted in the machinery of the physical world—from the action of a compass needle to the meandering of a river, and from the perversities of a gyroscope to the drive of Flettner’s rotor ship.\n\nPerhaps it’s no accident that a patent clerk discovered the theory of relativity.\n\n“Who else,” Wheeler writes, “could have distilled this simple central point from all the clutter of electromagnetism than someone whose job it was over and over to extract simplicity out of complexity.”\n\n> We have a passion for keeping things simple.\n> \n> Charlie Munger\n\nMost of us struggle to identify what deserves our attention. Our instinct is to [gather more information](https://fs.blog/more-information-decisions/), thinking it will clarify things.\n\nBut when you find yourself searching without knowing exactly what you’re seeking, it’s a sign you don’t truly understand the problem. Understanding brings the ability to know what information matters and what information doesn’t.\n\nWhen we treat all information as equally valuable, we inevitably overvalue the trivial and undervalue the essential.\n\nWhat sets the truly exceptional apart is their remarkable ability to focus on the few crucial variables while ignoring everything else.\n\n## What’s the Key Lesson?\n\nMost information we encounter doesn’t matter, and chasing it wastes precious time. When we learn what to ignore, we can focus our energy on what truly counts – and that focus leads to better results.\n\nThe good news is that we can all develop this ability to separate the essential from the noise. Here’s how:\n\n1.  **[Master fundamental principles that stand the test of time](https://fs.blog/mental-models/)** – use these as filters for evaluating ideas, people, and opportunities\n2.  **[Clarify your thinking through writing](https://fs.blog/how-to-think/)** – take time to step back and",

Part of what comes with seeing connections no one else sees is that not all of these connections actually exist.\n\nThe [same point of view](https://fs.blog/2013/09/a-technique-for-producing-ideas/) is offered by James Webb Young, who many years earlier, wrote:\n\n> An idea is nothing more nor less than a new combination of old elements \\[and\\] the capacity to bring old elements into new combinations depends largely on the ability to see relationships.\n\nA lot of creative luminaries think about creativity in the same way. Steve Jobs had a lot to say about creativity.\n\nIn [_I, Steve: Steve Jobs in His Own Words_](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1932841660/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=farnamstreet-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=1932841660&linkId=66296104b3b2cc5d0945bc697d6097d5), editor George Beahm draws on more than 30 years of media coverage of Steve Jobs in order to find Jobs’ most thought-provoking insights on many aspects of life and creativity.\n\nIn one particularly notable excerpt Jobs says:\n\n> **Creativity is just connecting things.** When you ask creative people how they did something, they feel a little guilty because they didn’t really do it, they just saw something. It seemed obvious to them after a while. That’s because they were able to connect experiences they’ve had and synthesize new things. And the reason they were able to do that was that they’ve had more experiences or they have thought more about their experiences than other people. Unfortunately, that’s too rare a commodity. A lot of people in our industry haven’t had very diverse experiences. So they don’t have enough dots to connect, and they end up with very linear solutions without a broad perspective on the problem. The broader one’s understanding of the human experience, the better design we will have.\n\nThe more you learn about, the more you can connect things. This becomes an argument for a broad-based education. In Jobs’ [2005 commencement address to the class of Stanford](https://fs.blog/2014/07/steve-jobs-stanford-commencement/), Jobs makes the case for learning things that, at the time, may not offer the most practical benefit. Over time, however, these things add up to give you a broader base of knowledge from which to connect ideas:\n\n> Throughout the campus every poster, every label on every drawer, was beautifully hand calligraphed. Because I had dropped out and didn’t have to take the normal classes, I decided to take a calligraphy class to learn how to do this. I learned about serif and san serif typefaces, about varying the amount of space between different letter combinations, about what makes great typography great. It was beautiful, historical, artistically subtle in a way that science can’t capture, and I found it fascinating.\n> \n> None of this had even a hope of any practical application in my life. But ten years later, when we were designing the first Macintosh computer, it all came back to me.\n\nWhile education is important for building up a repository for which you can connect things, it’s not enough. You need broad life experiences as well.\n\n[_I, Steve: Steve Jobs in His Own Words_](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1932841660/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=farnamstreet-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=1932841660&linkId=66296104b3b2cc5d0945bc697d6097d5) is full of things that will make you think.\n",

      "content": "\nPeter Thiel, the entrepreneur and investor who co-founded PayPal and Palantir, made the first outside investment in Facebook, and was an early investor in companies like SpaceX and LinkedIn, also wrote a book titled _[Zero to One: Notes on Startups, or How to Build the Future](https://amzn.to/4aKH2oC)_.\n\nThe book is an exercise in [thinking](https://fs.blog/how-to-think/) — about questioning and rethinking received wisdom to create the future and aims to help readers “see beyond the tracks laid down” to the “broader future that there is to create.”\n\nI’ve distilled eight key lessons from the book for anyone looking to challenge the status quo and make a meaningful impact.\n\n## 1\\. Each Moment Happens Once\n\nLike Heraclitus, who said that you can only [step into the same river once](https://fs.blog/heraclitus-fragments/), Thiel believes that each moment in business happens only once. Rather than try to copy Bill Gates, or Warren Buffett, you need to adapt to the current environment.\n\n> The next Bill Gates will not build an operating system. The next Larry Page or Sergey Brin won’t make a search engine. And the next Mark Zuckerberg won’t create a social network. If you are copying these guys, you aren’t learning from them.\n> \n> Of course, it’s easier to copy a model than to make something new. Doing what we already know how to do takes the world from 1 to n, adding more of something familiar. But every time we create something new, we go from 0 to 1. The act of creation is singular, as is the moment of creation, and the result is something fresh and strange.\n\n## 2\\. There is no Formula\n\nThere is no equation to teach entrepreneurship. Everything is constantly changing and you need to adapt. Entrepreneurship is more about mindset than math.\n\n> The paradox of teaching entrepreneurship is that such a formula (for innovation) cannot exist; because every innovation is new and unique, no authority can prescribe in concrete terms how to be more innovative. Indeed, the single most powerful pattern I have noticed is that successful people find value in unexpected places, and they do this by thinking about business from first principles instead of formulas.\n\n## 3\\. The Best Interview Question\n\n> Whenever I interview someone for a job, I like to ask this question: “What important truth do very few people agree with you on?”\n> \n> This is a question that sounds easy because it’s straightforward. Actually, it’s very hard to answer. It’s intellectually difficult because the knowledge that everyone is taught in school is by definition agreed upon. And it’s psychologically difficult because anyone trying to answer must say something she knows to be unpopular. Brilliant thinking is rare, but courage is in even shorter supply than genius.\n> \n> Most commonly, I hear answers like the following:\n> \n> “Our educational system is broken and urgently needs to be fixed.”\n> \n> “America is exceptional.”\n> \n> “There is no God.”\n> \n> These are bad answers. The first and the second statements might be true, but many people already agree with them. The third statement simply takes one side in a familiar debate. A good answer takes the following form: “Most people believe in x, but the truth is the opposite of x.”\n\nWhat does this have to do with the future?\n\n> In the most minimal sense, the future is simply the set of all moments yet to come. But what makes the future distinctive and important isn’t that it hasn’t happened yet, but rather that it will be a time when the world looks different from today. … Most answers to the contrarian questions are different ways of seeing the present; good answers are as close as we can come to looking into the future.\n\nThe reason this question is so valuable is that it’s hard to fake a good answer. This is very similar to the approach Elon uses to tell if someone is lying – [asking all the ways you failed](https://fs.blog/elon-musk-lying-experience/). While it’s easy for a bystander to take credit for the success, only the doer knows the failures.\n\n## 4\\. A Company’s Most Important Strength\n\nOne way that startups compete is with velocity. Large companies move slowly under the weight of bureaucracy. Startups are like swift gazelles, while large companies are like lumbering elephants. The gazelles can dart and weave through the landscape, outpacing the elephants who are slowed down by their size and weight.\n\n> Properly defined, a startup is the largest group of people you can convince of a plan to build a different future. A new company’s most important strength is new thinking: even more important than nimbleness, small size affords space to think.\n\n## 5\\. What Does Everyone Agree on?\n\nThe question “What important truth do very few people agree with you on?” is hard to answer initially. It’s better to start with, “What does everybody agree on?”\n\n> If you can identify a delusional popular belief, you can find what lies hidden behind it: the contrarian truth.\n> \n> \\[…\\]\n> \n> Conventional beliefs only ever come t",

Robin is the former lead instructor at the FBI’s Counterintelligence Training Center.\n\nThe FBI process is built on a foundation of psychology but tested with real field experience.\n\nHere is a brief, no-nonsense summary.\n\n## 1\\. Establish Artificial Time Constraints\n\nI suspect you’ve sat in a bar at one point or another and been approached by a stranger who tried to start a conversation. My guess is you felt awkward or possibly even uncomfortable. This is because you didn’t know when or if the conversation would end.\n\n> The first step in the process of developing great rapport and having great conversations is letting the other person know that there is an end in sight, and it is really close.\n\nWhen you approach someone to start a conversation, most people assess the situation for threat before anything else.\n\n> Humans have genetically survived because of this. This is a strong reason why these techniques work; they are specifically designed to lower the perceived risk to a stranger.\n\n## **2\\. Accommodating Nonverbals**\n\nThis is a pretty simple one. You want to look non-threatening.\n\nSmiling is the number one nonverbal technique to look more accommodating.\n\nThis isn’t new. It’s the second of six principles in Dale Carnegie’s book, [_How to Win Friends and Influence People_](https://fs.blog/how-to-win-friends-and-influence-people/).\n\nYou can, however, accentuate your smile subtly.\n\n> Adding a slight head tilt shows the other person that you have comfort with them and trust them. Another nonverbal to try and maintain is a slightly lower chin angle.\n\nHigh chin angles make someone feel like you’re looking down at them.\n\nAnother key nonverbal is body angle. Standing toe to toe with someone else can be intimidating.\n\n> A slight body angle or blade away from the individual you are engaging will present a much more accommodating nonverbal.\n\nHow you shake hands matters, too.\n\n> An accommodating handshake is one that matches the strength of the other, and also takes more of a palm up angle.\n\n## **3\\. Slower Rate of Speech**\n\nSpeaking fast may mean you’re excited. It may even mean that you know what you’re talking about. However, speaking slowly gives you more credibility.\n\n> Whenever I have a conversation that I believe is important for me to be credible in my content, I purposely slow down the delivery and take pauses for people to absorb the content of what I have just said.\n\n## **4\\. Sympathy or Assistance Theme**\n\nIf you’re like most people, you’ve felt a bit of regret for turning down someone seeking help.\n\n> Think for a moment about the times in your life when you have either sought assistance or been asked to provide it. When the request is simple, of limited duration, and non-threatening, we are more inclined to accommodate the request. As human beings, we are biologically conditioned to accommodate requests for assistance. The compulsion is based upon the fact that our ancient ancestors knew that if they did not provide assistance when asked, the assistance would not be granted to them if requested at a later date.\n\n## **5\\. Ego Suspension**\n\nThis may be the most rewarding and difficult of Robin’s techniques.\n\n> Suspending your ego is nothing more complex than putting other individuals’ wants, needs, and perceptions of reality ahead of your own. Most times, when two individuals engage in a conversation, each patiently waits for the other person to be done with whatever story he or she is telling. Then, the other person tells his or her own story, usually on a related topic and often times in an attempt to have a better and more interesting story. Individuals practicing good ego suspension would continue to encourage the other individual to talk about his or her story, neglecting their own need to share what they think is a great story.\n\n## **6\\. Validate Others**\n\nThere are many types of validation. Robin identifies three of them.\n\n1.  **Listening.** This is the simplest and one of the most effective. Just listening to someone can produce amazing results. Where we run into problems is keeping our own thoughts, ideas, and stories out of the conversation. “True validation coupled with ego suspension means that you have no story to offer, that you are there simply to hear theirs.” And there is another benefit. When the focus is on the other person, and we’re not anxious to tell our own story, we also tend to remember the details. We’re mindful.\n2.  **Thoughtfulness** “.. few people naturally use this to its fullest potential, and, most of the time, we don’t realize when it is being used; all we know is we really like the person who gives it.” Demonstrating thoughtfulness in words and actions with everyone is a simple and effective way to improve our relationships.\n3.  **Validate Thoughts and Opinions.** This technique is difficult because of",

      "content": "\nA brief, no fluff, summary of Mortimer Adlers’ [_How to Read a Book_](https://amzn.to/4bZyLhM).\n\nLet’s explore the four reading levels and how they can help you learn more.\n\n## The Four Levels of Reading\n\nIn _How to Read a Book_, Mortimer Adler identifies four levels of reading:\n\n1.  Elementary Reading\n2.  Inspectional Reading\n3.  Analytical Reading\n4.  Syntopical Reading\n\n**Think of these levels as reading to entertain, reading to inform, reading to understand, and reading to master.**\n\nWhen you learned to read in elementary school, you were taught to read for entertainment. If you made it to high school and college, you learned to read to inform. This is where most people stop. But most of the value comes at the last two levels.\n\nIn fact, if you don’t learn the last two levels, you’ll go through life like a one-legged man in an ass-kicking contest.\n\nThis doesn’t mean that everything should be read the same way. It shouldn’t. Why you are reading should match how you are reading. Your level of effort needs to match the importance of the material. If you read a romance novel and legal document the same way, you’re in for a life of misery.\n\n## 1\\. Reading to Entertain (Elementary)\n\nThis is the level of reading taught in our elementary schools. If you’re reading this website, you already know how.\n\n## 2\\. Reading to Inform (Inspectional)\n\nSome people think skimming and reading quickly is a bad idea. It’s not.\n\nThe point of a quick skim is to determine if the book is worth reading deeply in the first place. Most are not.\n\nThere are two kinds of inspectional reading:\n\n*   **Systematic skimming:** Quickly skim the book. Read the introduction, table of contents, index, and inside cover. This shows you the key chapters and ideas. Jump in and out, reading a paragraph here and there.\n*   **Superficial reading:** This is a quick read. Don’t stop to think deeply. Don’t write things in the margin. Don’t look things up; keep going if you don’t understand something. Read most of the book, but read it quickly.\n\nAt this point, you have the main idea. Often, that’s enough. Think about all the pop-psychology books. Simply skimming the introduction gives you 90% of the value.\n\nInspectional reading gives you the structure and an overview of the author’s arguments and opinions. Because you didn’t read deeply, you won’t understand all the nuances, but you’ll get the gist.\n\nMost times, you can stop right here. Put the book down and go on to the next one.\n\nBut sometimes, you’ll want to know more about the book.\n\n## 3\\. Reading to Understand ([Analytical](https://fs.blog/the-art-of-reading-analytical-reading/))\n\nFrancis Bacon once remarked, “some books are to be tasted, others to be swallowed, and some few to be chewed and digested.”\n\nYou can think of analytical reading as doing that chewing and digesting. This is the real work of reading.\n\nIf inspectional reading is the best you can do quickly, analytical reading is the best you can do with time.\n\nAt this point, you start to engage your mind and do the work required to understand what’s being said. I recommend writing in your book and using [our Blank Sheet notetaking method](https://fs.blog/blank-sheet-method/).\n\n**There are four rules to Analytical Reading**\n\n1.  Classify the book according to its kind and subject matter\n2.  State what the whole book is about with the utmost brevity\n3.  Enumerate its major parts in their order and relation, and outline these parts\n4.  Define the problem or problems the author is trying to solve\n\nYou’ll probably notice that while those sound pretty easy, they involve a lot of work. Luckily, the inspectional reading you did earlier has primed you for this and made it easier.\n\nIf you are reading to understand, you need to integrate the ideas into your head. You simply must do the work of digesting the material and making it your own. Done correctly, this helps you understand the book. That does not mean, however, that you understand the broader subject.\n\nYou can’t simply read one book or article and claim to be an expert.\n\nIf you really want to master the subject, you need to dive into the subject entirely reading multiple books and comparing and contrasting them. That’s where syntopical reading comes in.\n\n## 4\\. Reading to Master (Syntopical)\n\nSyntopical reading is the most demanding and challenging reading of all.\n\nReading to master something involves reading many books on the same subject and comparing and contrasting ideas, vocabulary, and arguments. To do this, you must identify relevant passages, translate terminology, define the issues, explore issues through multiple lenses, and frame questions that need answering.\n\nThe goal is not to achieve an overall understanding of any _particular_ book but rather to understand the broader subject and develop deep fluency. Doing this means identifying and filling in your blind spots about the subject,\n\n**When reading to master something, there are four keys to keep in mind**\n\n1.  **Identify the relevan",

How do you find more time to read than the average person?\n\nWell, first, there is no secret. As simple as it sounds, **finding time to read boils down to choices** about how you allocate your time. And allocating your time is how successful people [increase productivity](https://fs.blog/2015/04/saying-no-how-successful-people-stay-productive/).\n\nIn a good week, I can read three to five books. Sometimes fewer. I’m an average reader, likely within one standard deviation in terms of speed and retention. In short, I’m no different from you when it comes to how fast I read.\n\nFor example, while remarkably enjoyable, _[Blood and Beauty](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1400069297/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1400069297&linkCode=as2&tag=farnamstreet-20)_ consumed almost a week. I was incredibly slow reading [_Seneca’s Epistles 1-65_](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0674990846/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0674990846&linkCode=as2&tag=farnamstreet-20)_,_ and even slower with [_Antifragile_](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1400067820/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=farnamstreet-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=1400067820&linkId=d0d28d2424326ff3226ed525c676f24d). These are books I don’t want to rush. On the other hand, I can cruise through something like [_Fate of the States_](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/159184570X/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=159184570X&linkCode=as2&tag=farnamstreet-20) in an afternoon.\n\nWhen reading, [I generally take notes](https://fs.blog/2014/05/remembering-what-you-read/). I’m underlining, synthesizing, asking questions, and relating concepts from other things I’ve read.\n\nAfter I finish a book, I let it age for a week or two and then pick it up again. I look at my notes and the sections I’ve marked as important. I write them down. Or I let the book age for another week or two.\n\n## Finding More Time to Read\n\nLet’s look at this another way. Rather than say what I do, I’ll tell you what I don’t do.\n\n**What gets in the way of reading?**\n\nI don’t spend a lot of time watching TV. (The lone exception to this is during football season, when I watch one game a week.)\n\nI watch very few movies.\n\nI don’t spend a lot of time commuting.\n\nI don’t spend a lot of time shopping.\n\nThese choices are deliberate. I don’t even have cable TV. I watch NFL through Game Pass, which also saves time (if you don’t watch games live, you can watch the full game in under 30 minutes).\n\nI live downtown; I can walk to the grocery store, purchase a bagful of groceries, and return home all within 15 minutes.\n\nIf you assume that the average person spends 3–4 hours a day watching TV, an hour or more commuting, and another 2–3 hours a week shopping, that’s 28 hours a week on the low end.\n\nTwenty-eight hours. That’s 1,680 minutes. That’s huge. If you read a page a minute, that’s more than 1,600 pages a week.\n\n## Books Are Important\n\nFew things are as rewarding as making friends with the eminent dead. **Reading isn’t something to be done once a week to check a box; it’s something to do every day.**\n\nIf you’re a knowledge worker, you’re paid to use your brain, so it’s in your best interest to make that brain as big as possible.\n\nWherever I go, a book is not far behind. It might be on my phone or physical, but there is always a book close by.\n\nFinding time to read is easier than you might think. Waiting for a bus? Stop staring down the street and read. Waiting for a taxi? Read. On the train? Read. On the plane? Read. Waiting for your flight? Read.\n\n**What I read depends on the situation.**\n\nIf I know I have only a few minutes, I’m not going to read something that requires a lot of mental context switching to get back into. I’ll keep it simple, with something like Phil Jackson’s [_Eleven Rings: The Soul of Success_](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1594205116/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1594205116&linkCode=as2&tag=farnamstreet-20) or _[Grow Regardless](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/161448435X/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=161448435X&linkCode=as2&tag=farnamstreet-20)_. Waiting around is also a great time to read magazines and printed copies of articles from the web. These tend to be short, rather disposable, and easily digested.\n\nEarly in the evening, say around 8 or 9, I’ll grab a glass of wine and sink into something serious.

They showed consistent learning compounds, building understanding, and multiplying opportunities over time.\n\nConsider how Munger’s fascination with psychology led him to [spot cognitive biases decades before they became mainstream in business thinking](https://fs.blog/great-talks/psychology-human-misjudgment/). This insight helped Berkshire avoid common investment traps and identify opportunities others missed.\n\nTheir example offers valuable lessons about turning information into insight. Let’s explore how deliberate learning, driven by real curiosity, can help you build deeper understanding and spot opportunities others miss. I call it the Buffett Formula.\n\n> The best thing a human being can do is to help another human being know more.\n> \n> Charlie Munger\n\n## Reading Powers The Mind\n\nWarren Buffett spends 80% of his working day reading and thinking. When asked how to get smarter, he held up a stack of papers and gave simple advice: read 500 pages weekly. Knowledge, he explained, compounds like interest.\n\nHis partner Charlie Munger shares this habit – they’re known for spending more time reading than perhaps any other business partnership.\n\n> Go to bed smarter than when you woke up.\n> \n> Charlie Munger\n\nThis approach works. Todd Combs took Buffett’s advice seriously, tracking his daily reading pages. He now works alongside Buffett, having turned dedicated reading into career-changing insight.\n\nThe _Omaha World-Herald_ [writes](http://www.omaha.com/article/20130428/MONEY/704289987):\n\n> Eventually finding and reading productive material became second nature, a habit. As he began his investing career, he would read even more, hitting 600, 750, even 1,000 pages a day.\n> \n> Combs discovered that Buffett’s formula worked, giving him more knowledge that helped him with what became his primary job—seeking the truth about potential investments.\n\nThe method is available to anyone. But, like compound interest, it only works if you start and stick with it.\n\nIn _[Working Together: Why Great Partnerships Succeed](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0055X53ZO/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B0055X53ZO&linkCode=as2&tag=farnamstreet-20),_ Buffett comments to author Michael Eisner:\n\n> Look, my job is essentially just corralling more and more and more facts and information, and occasionally seeing whether that leads to some action. And Charlie—his children call him a book with legs.\n\n## Continuous Learning\n\nEisner continues:\n\n> Maybe that’s why both men agree it’s better that they never lived in the same city, or worked in the same office. They would have wanted to talk all the time, leaving no time for the reading, which Munger describes as part of an essential continuing education program for the men who run one of the largest conglomerates in the world.\n> \n> “I don’t think any other twosome in business was better at continuous learning than we were,” he says, talking in the past tense but not really meaning it. “And if we hadn’t been continuous learners, the record wouldn’t have been as good. And we were so extreme about it that we both spent the better part of our days reading, so we could learn more, which is not a common pattern in business.”\n\n## Beyond Reading: A Different Kind of Work\n\nTheir process isn’t about crunching numbers; it’s about the lost art of thinking. “We don’t read other people’s opinions,” Warren explains. “We want to get the facts, and then think.”\n\nWhile it’s a convenient excuse to think they were both geniuses, it misses the point that you can improve through continuous learning over a long life.\n\nMunger told a reporter, “Neither Warren nor I is smart enough to make decisions with no time to think. We make actual decisions very rapidly, but that’s because we’ve spent so much time preparing ourselves by quietly sitting and reading and thinking.”\n\nTaking time to think is one of the [two ways to immediately improve the quality of your thoughts](https://fs.blog/how-to-think/).\n\n## How to Find Time to Read\n\n[Finding time to read](https://fs.blog/finding-time-to-read/) is a choice about investing in yourself. As Buffett recounts in _[The Snowball](https://amzn.to/41cug0W)_, Munger discovered this early in his career:\n\n> Charlie, as a very young lawyer, was probably getting $20 an hour. He thought to himself, “Who’s my most valuable client?” And he decided it was himself. So he decided to sell himself an hour each day. He did it early in the morning, working on these construction projects and real estate deals. Everybody should do this, be the client, and then work for other people, too, and sell yourself an hour a day.\n\nThis choice has lasting consequences.\n\nAn hour spent on social media and email quickly perishes.

      "content": "\nWhat if saving one life could doom millions?\n\nIn Stephen King’s _11/22/63_, a man named Jake discovers a portal that transports him back to 1958. Determined to prevent the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, he believes this single act will benefit humanity. After years of meticulous planning, he succeeds in altering history. But when he returns to the present, he finds a world ravaged by earthquakes and nuclear war—a dystopian reality far worse than the one he left behind. Devastated, Jake goes back once more to reset the timeline.\n\nThis gripping tale illustrates a profound truth: small changes can trigger vast and unpredictable outcomes in complex systems. This phenomenon is known as the butterfly effect—the idea that tiny actions can have non-linear impacts on a global scale.\n\nRather than imagining a butterfly causing a typhoon, consider how a minor software glitch can cascade into a massive system failure, affecting millions. In our interconnected world, initial conditions are everything. As John Gribbin writes in _Deep Simplicity_, “Some systems are very sensitive to their starting conditions, so that a tiny difference in the initial ‘push’ you give them causes a big difference in where they end up, and there is feedback, so that what a system does affects its own behavior.”\n\nUnderstanding the butterfly effect offers a new lens through which to view business, markets, and life itself. It reminds us that every action, no matter how small, can set off a chain of events we might never foresee. So the next time you make a decision, remember: you could be unleashing consequences far beyond your imagination.\n\n> You could not remove a single grain of sand from its place without thereby … changing something throughout all parts of the immeasurable whole.\n> \n> Fichte, The Vocation of Man (1800)  \n\n## What the Butterfly Effect Is Not\n\nThe point of the butterfly effect is not to gain [leverage](https://fs.blog/leverage/). As General Stanley McChrystal writes in _[Team of Teams](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1591847486/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=farnamstreet-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=1591847486&linkId=8a1b76f8786db768e8b5767d449e31da)_:\n\n> In popular culture, the term “butterfly effect” is almost always misused. It has become synonymous with “leverage”—the idea of a small thing that has a big impact, with the implication that, like a lever, it can be manipulated to a desired end. This misses the point of Lorenz’s insight. The reality is that small things in a complex system may have no effect or a massive one, and it is virtually impossible to know which will turn out to be the case.\n\nBenjamin Franklin offered a poetic perspective in [his variation of a proverb](https://www.bookbrowse.com/expressions/detail/index.cfm/expression_number/558/for-want-of-a-nail-the-kingdom-was-lost) that’s been around since the 14th century in English and the 13th century in German, long before the identification of the butterfly effect:\n\n> For want of a nail the shoe was lost,  \n> For want of a shoe the horse was lost,  \n> For want of a horse the rider was lost,  \n> For want of a rider the battle was lost,  \n> For want of a battle the kingdom was lost,  \n> And all for the want of a horseshoe nail.\n\nThe lack of one horseshoe nail could be inconsequential, or it could indirectly cause the loss of a war. There is no way to predict which outcome will occur. (If you want an excellent book to teach this idea to your children, check out _[If You Give a Mouse a Cookie](https://amzn.to/3y7gWik)_.)\n\nIn this post, we will seek to unravel the butterfly effect from its many incorrect connotations and build an understanding of how it affects our individual lives and the world in general.\n\n## Edward Lorenz and the Discovery of the Butterfly Effect\n\n> It used to be thought that the events that changed the world were things like big bombs, maniac politicians, huge earthquakes, or vast population movements, but it has now been realized that this is a very old-fashioned view held by people totally out of touch with modern thought. The things that change the world, according to Chaos theory, are the tiny things. A butterfly flaps its wings in the Amazonian jungle, and subsequently a storm ravages half of Europe.\n> \n> Good Omens, by Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman\n\nAlthough the concept of the butterfly effect has long been debated, the identification of it as a distinct effect is credited to Edward Lorenz (1917–2008).\n\nLorenz was a meteorologist and mathematician who combined the two disciplines to create chaos theory. During the 1950s, he searched for a means of predicting the weather, as he found linear models ineffective.\n\nIn an experiment to model a weather prediction, he entered the initial condition as 0.506, instead of 0.506127. The result was surprising: a very different prediction. From this, he deduced that the weather must turn on a dime. A tiny change in the initial conditions had enormous long-term impl",

[It comes down to mindset](https://fs.blog/carol-dweck-mindset/).\n\nOver time, the person who approaches life with an openness to being wrong and a willingness to learn outperforms the person who doesn’t.\n\n## How do you respond to anomalies?\n\nHow you respond to anomalies is a good indicator of your open-mindedness.\n\nAnomalies are like a glitch in the matrix. You can identify these moments when you find something surprising, missing, or strange.\n\nAnomalies indicate the world doesn’t work the way you thought it did. These moments can be worth their weight in gold if you pay attention.\n\nClosed-minded people tend to ignore or gloss over anomalies. Open-minded people want to dive in and understand. Of course, diving in is hard as it may require you to discard your ideas and beliefs.\n\nAnomalies are not the only way to figure out which mindset people are operating with. In his book _[Principles](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1501124021/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=farnamstreet-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=1501124021&linkId=d6bc819325adf607d61ce16dd79f2efd)_, Ray Dalio, self-made billionaire and founder of the largest hedge fund in the world, lays out seven other ways to tell the difference.\n\n## 1\\. Challenging Ideas\n\n> Closed-minded people don’t want their ideas challenged. They are typically frustrated that they can’t get the other person to agree with them instead of curious as to why the other person disagrees.\n\nClosed-minded people put their ego ahead of the outcome. They refrain from inquiring and instead focus on disproving others without attempting to comprehend their perspectives. They tend to become frustrated when questioned and perceive those who seek clarification as hindrances to progress. They tend to easily get angered with people who disagree.\n\nIn short, they’re on [the wrong side of right](https://fs.blog/wrong-side-right/).\n\n> Open-minded people are more curious about why there is disagreement. … They understand that there is always the possibility that they might be wrong and that it’s worth the little bit of time it takes to consider the other person’s views….\n\nOpen-minded people find learning in everything. They see disagreement as a thoughtful means to expand their knowledge. They don’t get angry or upset at questions; rather, they want to identify where the disagreement lies so they can correct their misperceptions. They realize that being right means changing their minds when someone else knows something they don’t.\n\n## 2\\. Statements vs. Questions\n\n> Closed-minded people are more likely to make statements than ask questions.\n\nClosed-minded people listen to win not to understand. They sit in meetings and are more than willing to offer their opinions but never ask other people to expand on, or explain, their ideas. Closed-minded people think of how they would refute the other person rather than trying to understand what they might be missing.\n\n> Open-minded people genuinely believe they could be wrong; the questions that they ask are genuine.\n\nOpen-minded people know that while they may have an opinion on a subject, it could count for less than someone else’s. Maybe they’re outside their circle of competence or maybe they’re experts. Regardless, they’re always curious as to how people see things differently and they weigh their opinions accordingly.\n\n## 3\\. Understanding\n\n> Closed-minded people focus much more on being understood than on understanding others.\n\nPeople’s default behaviors offer a quick tell. When you disagree with someone, what’s their reaction? If they’re quick to rephrase what they just said or, even worse, repeat it, without asking any questions, then they are assuming that you don’t understand them rather than that you disagree with them.\n\n> Open-minded people feel compelled to see things through others’ eyes.\n\nWhen you disagree with an open-minded person, they are quick to assume that they might not understand something and to ask you to tell them where their understanding is incomplete.\n\n## 4\\. I Might Be Wrong, But…\n\nDalio nails this one. I have nothing to add.\n\n> Closed-minded people say things like “I could be wrong … but here’s my opinion.” This is a classic cue I hear all the time. It’s often a perfunctory gesture that allows people to hold their own opinion while convincing themselves that they are being open-minded. If your statement starts with “I could be wrong”…, you should probably follow it with a question and not an assertion.\n\n> Open-minded people know when to make statements and when to ask questions.\n\n## 5\\. Just Shut Up\n\n> “Closed-minded people block others from speaking.”\n\nClosed-minded people don’t have time to rehash something already talked about. They don’t want to hear anyone’s voice but their own.\n\n(Dalio offers a “two-minut",

      "content": "\nThe Feynman Technique is the best way to supercharge your learning. And it works no matter the subject. Devised by Nobel Prize-winning physicist Richard Feynman, it leverages the power of teaching for better learning.\n\nLearning doesn’t happen from skimming through a book or remembering enough to pass a test.\n\nInformation is learned when you can explain it and use it in a wide variety of situations. The Feynman Technique gets more mileage from the ideas you encounter instead of rendering anything new into isolated, useless factoids.\n\nWhen you really learn something, you give yourself a tool to use for the rest of your life. The more you know, the fewer surprises you will encounter because most new things will connect to something you already understand.\n\nUltimately, the point of learning is to understand the world. But most of us don’t bother to deliberately learn anything.\n\nWe memorize what we need to as we move through school, then forget most of it. As we continue through life, we don’t extrapolate from our experiences to broaden the applicability of our knowledge. Consequently, life kicks us in the ass time and again.\n\nTo avoid the pain of being bewildered by the unexpected, the Feynman Technique helps you turn information into knowledge that you can access as easily as reaching for a chair.\n\n\\*\n\n## The Feynman Technique\n\n> “Any intelligent fool can make things bigger, more complex, and more violent. It takes a touch of genius—and a lot of courage—to move in the opposite direction.”\n> \n> E.F. Schumacher\n\n**There are four steps to the Feynman Learning Technique**, based on the method Richard Feynman originally used. We have adapted it slightly after reflecting on our own experiences using this process to learn. The steps are as follows:\n\n1.  Pretend to teach a concept you want to learn about to a student in the sixth grade.\n2.  Identify gaps in your explanation. Go back to the source material to better understand it.\n3.  Organize and simplify.\n4.  Transmit (optional).\n\n**Step 1: Pretend to teach it to a child**\n\nTake out a blank sheet of paper. At the top, write the subject you want to master. Now write out everything you know about the subject as if you were teaching it to a child or a rubber duck sitting on your desk.\n\nIt’s important to remember that you are not teaching to your smart adult friend, but rather a child who has just enough vocabulary and attention span to understand basic concepts and relationships. It has to be simple and clear. There is nowhere to hide in obfuscation.\n\nOr, for a different angle on the Feynman Technique, you could place a rubber duck on your desk and try explaining the concept to it. Software engineers sometimes tackle debugging by explaining their code, line by line, to a rubber duck. It sounds silly, but it’s a forcing function to make you walk through your thinking as simply as possible.\n\nIt turns out that one of the ways we mask our lack of understanding is by using complicated vocabulary and jargon. The truth is, **if you can’t clearly and simply define the words and terms you are using, you don’t really know what you’re talking about.**\n\nIf you look at a painting and describe it as “abstract” because that’s what you heard in art class, you demonstrate no understanding. You’re just mimicking what you’ve heard. You haven’t learned anything.\n\nWhen you write out an idea from start to finish in simple language that a child can understand, you force yourself to understand the concept at a deeper level and simplify relationships and connections between ideas. You can better explain the why behind your description of the what.\n\n****Writing helps you think because it gives you nowhere to hide.****\n\nLooking at the painting again, you will be able to say that the painting doesn’t display buildings like the ones we look at every day. Instead, it uses certain shapes and colors to depict a city landscape. You will be able to point out what these are. You will be able to engage in speculation about why the artist chose those shapes and those colors. You will be able to explain why artists sometimes do this, and you will be able to communicate what you think of the piece considering all of this.\n\nChances are, after capturing a full explanation of the painting in the simplest possible terms that would be easily understood by a sixth-grader, you will have learned a lot about that painting and abstract art in general.\n\nSome of capturing what you would teach will be easy. These are the places where you have a clear understanding of the subject. But you will find many places where things are much foggier.\n\n**Step 2: Identify gaps in your explanation**\n\nAreas, where you struggle in Step 1, are the points where you have some gaps in your understanding.\n\nIdentifying gaps in your knowledge—where you forget something important, aren’t able to explain it, or simply have trouble thinking of how variables interact—is a critical part of the learning process.\n\nFilling those gaps is when you real",

      "content": "\nGreat decisions come from understanding where you have an advantage.\n\nTed Williams, baseball’s last .400 hitter, demonstrated this principle through a remarkably systematic approach to hitting.\n\nWilliams divided the strike zone into 77 squares, mapping his success rate for each area. This detailed self-knowledge revealed a crucial insight: when he waited for pitches in his sweet spot, he hit .400; when he swung at marginal pitches, his average dropped to .230-.250.\n\n![Ted Williams: The Science of Hitting and What it can Teach you about Making Better Decisions](https://fs.blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/williams_strike_zone.png)\n\nSource: The Science of Hitting\n\nPut differently, when he was patient and waited for the right pitch, he hit better than when he was impatient and needed to swing. Simple but not easy.\n\nWaiting for the right pitch is simple but not easy.\n\nThis principle extends far beyond baseball. Top performers in any field succeed by:\n\n1.  [Identifying their circle of competence](https://fs.blog/circle-of-competence/) – areas where they have genuine expertise\n2.  Recognizing the boundaries of that expertise\n3.  Patiently waiting for opportunities within their sweet spot\n\nWarren Buffett exemplifies this approach in investing. He writes: “If we have a strength, it is in recognizing when we are well within our cycle of competence and when we are approaching the perimeter.”\n\nLike Williams, Buffett waits for the perfect pitch, reviewing thousands of investments to find ones squarely within his expertise.\n\nUnlike Williams, Buffett can’t be called “out” on strikes if he resists pitches that are barely in the strike zone. He can, quite literally, wait for the perfect pitch—looking at thousands of different investments before finding one that is just right.\n\nMost of us, however, simply can’t wait forever. Sometimes, we’re forced to make a decision. Interestingly, there is a parallel with hitting again.\n\nConsider this excerpt from _[Clear Thinking: Turning Ordinary Moments into Extraordinary Results](https://geni.us/FG4odAE)_:\n\n> “You don’t need to be smarter than others to outperform them if you can out-position them. Anyone looks like a genius when they’re in a good position, and even the smartest person looks like an idiot when they’re in a bad one.\n\nSounds like Williams, who understood that average batters could become great if they waited for the right pitch, and even the best could become average if they swung at the wrong pitch.\n\n> A good hitter can hit a pitch that is over the plate three times better than a great hitter with a questionable ball in a tough spot.\n\nTwo key strategies for operating outside your circle of competence:\n\n1.  Focus on positioning rather than prediction\n2.  Build in a [margin of safety](https://fs.blog/margin-of-safety/) to account for uncertainty\n\nSuccess comes not from expanding your circle of competence endlessly but from:\n\n*   Clearly mapping its boundaries\n*   Operating primarily within it\n*   Take careful, protected steps when venturing beyond it.\n",

What you do with that information will determine your place in history.\n\nThe imminent arrival of AGI has pushed many to try to [seize the levers of power as quickly as possible](https://danfaggella.com/flex/), leaping towards projects that, if successful, would comprehensively automate all work. There is a [trillion-dollar](https://am.jpmorgan.com/gb/en/asset-management/per/insights/market-insights/investment-outlook/ai-investment/#:~:text=According%20to%20data,Exhibit%2014\\).) arms race to see who can achieve such a capability first, with [trillions more](https://www.mechanize.work/#:~:text=The%20market%20potential%20here%20is%20absurdly%20large%3A%20workers%20in%20the%20US%20are%20paid%20around%20%2418%20trillion%20per%20year%20in%20aggregate.%20For%20the%20entire%20world%2C%20the%20number%20is%20over%20three%20times%20greater%2C%20around%20%2460%20trillion%20per%20year.) in gains to be won.\n\nYes, that means you’ll lose your job. But it goes beyond that: this will remove the need for regular people in our economy. Powerful actors—like states and companies—no longer have an incentive to care about regular people. We call this **the intelligence curse**.\n\nIf we do nothing, the intelligence curse will work like this:\n\n*   Powerful AI will push automation through existing organizations, starting from the bottom and moving to the top.\n*   AI will obsolete even outlier human talent. Social mobility will stop, ending the social dynamism and progress that it drives.\n*   Non-human factors of production, like capital, resources, and control over AI, will become overwhelmingly more important than humans.\n*   This will usher in incentives for powerful actors around the world that break the modern social contract.\n*   This could result in the [gradual](https://gradual-disempowerment.ai/)—or [sudden](https://www.forethought.org/research/ai-enabled-coups-how-a-small-group-could-use-ai-to-seize-power)—disempowerment of the vast majority of humanity.\n\nBut this prophecy is not yet fulfilled; we _reject_ the view that this path is inevitable. We see a different future on the horizon, but it will require a deliberate and concerted effort to achieve it.\n\nWe aim to change the incentives driving the intelligence curse, maintaining human economic relevance and strengthening our democratic institutions to withstand what will likely be the greatest societal disruption in history.\n\nTo break the intelligence curse, we should chart a different path on the tech tree_,_ building technology that lets us:\n\n1.  **Avert** AI catastrophes by hardening the world against them, both because it is good in itself and because it removes the security threats that drive calls for centralization.\n2.  **Diffuse** AI, to get it in the hands of regular people. In the short-term, build AI that augments human capabilities. In the long-term, align AI directly to individual users and give everyone control in the AI economy.\n3.  **Democratize** institutions, making them more anchored to the needs of humans even as they are buffeted by the changing incentive landscape and fast-moving events of the AGI transition.\n\nIn this series of essays, we examine the incoming crisis of human irrelevance and provide a map towards a future where people remain the masters of their destiny.\n\n* * *\n\n## Chapters\n\n### 1\\. **Introduction** (this page)\n\nWe will soon live in the intelligence age.

Taking the most respectful interpretation of events changes how you see others and how they behave toward you._ \n\nConsider this situation: You email a colleague with a question expecting a prompt response, but hours or days later you’ve yet to hear from them. Perhaps you can’t move forward on your project without their input so you find yourself blocked. _How do you imagine you feel in this situation?_\n\nFor many of us, situations like this result in feelings of anger, frustration, or annoyance. Maybe we take it personally and conclude that our colleague is lazy or that they don’t value our time or our work. Perhaps we send off a terse reminder asking for an update.\n\nIf we’re feeling particularly revengeful, we alert the person’s manager or mention our grievance to another colleague looking for validation that the offending colleague is in fact lazy and disrespectful – a form of [confirmation bias](https://fs.blog/2017/05/confirmation-bias/).\n\nPerhaps this colleague has been slow to respond to communications in the past, thus we extrapolate that to all of their communications, a case of the [fundamental attribution error](https://fs.blog/2016/08/fundamental-attribution-error/).\n\nOf course, it’s natural to feel anger and frustration when faced with these situations. But is anger the appropriate response?\n\nIn the [Nicomachean Ethics](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0872204642/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=farnamstreet-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0872204642&linkId=d27dbb74b91e563160633b695b27af99) **Aristotle** wrote about _The Virtue Concerned with Anger_. He begins Book IV with a description of good temper:\n\n> The man who is angry at the right things and with the right people, and, further, as he ought, when he ought, and as long as he ought, is praised. This will be the good-tempered man, then, since good temper is praised.\n\nAristotle tells us that anger has a time and place and that when applied to the right people and for the right reason, is justified and even praiseworthy. But we have to use anger judiciously:\n\n> For the good-tempered man tends to be unperturbed and not to be led by passion, but to be angry in the manner, at the things, and for the length of time, that reason dictates; but he is thought to err rather in the direction of deficiency; for the good-tempered man is not revengeful, but rather tends to make allowances.\n\nIn Aristotle’s description of good temper, he encourages us to err in the direction of “making allowances”. But how can we do this in practice?\n\nLet’s return to our example.\n\nWe take our colleague’s lack of response personally and assume they are lazy or disrespectful, but it is important for us to recognize that we are _assuming_. We often instinctively chose to assume the _worst_ of people, because it slips easily into mind. But what if instead we chose to assume the _best_?\n\nIn her book [Rising Strong](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0812995821/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=farnamstreet-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0812995821&linkId=6a5032bd14627e4d9d3968cd8814bc6b), Brené Brown describes how she learned to assume that people are doing the best they can and shares a concept introduced to her by Dr. Jean Kantambu Latting, a professor at University of Houston. Brown writes:\n\n> Whenever someone would bring up a conflict with a colleague, she would ask, ‘What is the hypothesis of generosity? **What is the most generous assumption you can make about this person’s intentions or what this person said?’**\n\nBy pausing to reflect on our anger we can recognize that we are making a negative assumption and challenge ourselves to [invert the situation](https://fs.blog/2013/10/inversion/) and consider the opposite: “What is the most generous assumption I can make?”\n\nPerhaps our colleague has been given a higher priority project, or they don’t understand that we’re blocked without their input. Maybe they are dealing with some personal challenges outside of the office, or they need input from somebody else to reply to our message and thus they’re blocked as well. Perhaps they’ve decided to reduce their email frequency in order to focus on important work.\n\nWhen we pause to look at the situation from another angle, not only do we entertain some explanations that frame our colleagues in a more positive light, but we put ourselves into their shoes; the very definition of empathy.\n\nWe’ve all had competing priorities, distractions from personal issues outside of work, miscommunications regarding the urgent need of our response, etc. Do we think others judged us fairly or unfairly in those moments?\n\nThe point is not to make excuses or avoid addressing problems with our colleagues, but that if we recognize we are making negative assumptions by default, we might need to challenge ourselves to consider more generous alternatives. This may alter the way we approach ",

Well, the answer is obvious: He hasn’t died yet.”_\n\nFortunately for us, Munger has kept on ticking. The commencement speech is an excellent response to the Big Question: _How do we live a life that really works?_ It has so many of Munger’s core ideas that we think the speech represents the **Munger Operating System** for life.\n\n![](https://fs.blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/The-Munger-Operating-System.jpg)\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nTo get what you want, deserve what you want. Trust, success, and admiration are earned. \n\n> It’s such a simple idea. It’s the golden rule so to speak: You want to deliver to the world what you would buy if you were on the other end. There is no ethos, in my opinion, that is better for any lawyer or any other person to have. By and large the people who have this ethos win in life and they don’t win just money, not just honors. They win the respect, the deserved trust of the people they deal with, and there is huge pleasure in life to be obtained from getting deserved trust.\n\nLearn to love and admire the right people, alive or dead.\n\n> A second idea that I got very early was that there is no love that’s so right as admiration-based love, and that love should include the instructive dead. Somehow, I got that idea and I lived with it all my life; and it’s been very, very useful to me.\n\nAcquiring wisdom is a moral duty as well as a practical one. \n\n> And there’s a corollary to that proposition which is very important. It means that you’re hooked for lifetime learning, and without lifetime learning you people are not going to do very well. You are not going to get very far in life based on what you already know. You’re going to advance in life by what you’re going to learn after you leave here…if civilization can progress only when it invents the method of invention, you can progress only when you learn the method of learning.\n\nAttain fluency on [the big multidisciplinary ideas](https://fs.blog/mental-models/) of the world and use them regularly. \n\n> What I noted since the really big ideas carry 95% of the freight, it wasn’t at all hard for me to pick up all the big ideas from all the big disciplines and make them a standard part of my mental routines. Once you have the ideas, of course, they are no good if you don’t practice — if you don’t practice you lose it.\n> \n> So I went through life constantly practicing this model of the multidisciplinary approach. Well, I can’t _tell_ you what that’s done for me. It’s made life more fun, it’s made me more constructive, it’s made me more helpful to others, it’s made me enormously rich, you name it, that attitude really helps.\n> \n> Now there are dangers there, because it works so well, that if you do it, you will frequently find you are sitting in the presence of some other expert, maybe even an expert that’s superior to you, supervising you. And you will know more than he does about his own specialty, a lot more. You will see the correct answer when he’s missed it.\n> \n> \\[…\\]\n> \n> It doesn’t help you just to know them enough just so you can give them back on an exam and get an A. You have to learn these things in such a way that they’re in a mental latticework in your head and you automatically use them for the rest of your life.\n\nLearn to think through problems [backwards](https://fs.blog/charlie-munger-thinking-backward-forward/) as well as forward.\n\n> The way complex adaptive systems work and the way mental constructs work, problems frequently get easier and I would even say usually _are_ easier to solve if you turn around in reverse.\n> \n> In other words if you want to help India, the question you should ask is not “how can I help India?”, you think “what’s doing the worst damage in India? What would automatically do the worst damage and how do I avoid it?” You’d think they are logically the same thing, but they’re not. Those of you who have mastered algebra know that inversion frequently will solve problems which nothing else will solve. And in life, unless you’re more gifted than Einstein, inversion will help you solve problems that you can’t solve in other ways.\n\nBe reliable. Unreliability can cancel out the other virtues.\n\n> If you’re unreliable it doesn’t matter what your virtues are, you’re going to crater immediately. So doing what you have faithfully engaged to do should be an automatic part of your conduct. You want to avoid sloth and unreliability.\n\nAvoid intense ideologies. Always [consider the other side](https://fs.blog/the-work-required-to-have-an-opinion/) as carefully as your own.\n\n> Another thing I think should be avoided is extremely intense ideology, because it cabbages up one’s mind. You’ve seen that. You see a lot of it on TV, you know preachers for instance, they’ve all got different ideas about theology and a lot of th",

Understand how your subconscious might be leading you astray.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nWhile most of us make decisions daily, few of us have a useful framework for thinking that protects us when making decisions.\n\nWe’re going to explore Munger’s two-step process for making effective decisions and reducing human misjudgment.\n\nIn [A Lesson on Elementary Worldly Wisdom](https://fs.blog/great-talks/a-lesson-on-worldly-wisdom/), [Charlie Munger](https://fs.blog/charlie-munger/) offers **a simple two-step filter for making effective decisions**:\n\n> Personally, I’ve gotten so that I now use a kind of two-track analysis. First, what are the factors that really govern the interests involved, rationally considered? And second, what are the subconscious influences where the brain at a subconscious level is automatically doing these things-which by and large are useful, but which often misfunction.\n> \n> One approach is rationality-the way you’d work out a bridge problem: by evaluating the real interests, the real probabilities and so forth. And the other is to evaluate the psychological factors that cause subconscious conclusions-many of which are wrong.\n\nLet’s take a closer look.\n\n## 1\\. The Forces at Play\n\nThe key to the first step is **knowing what you know and what you don’t know**. You need to understand your [circle of competence](https://fs.blog/2013/12/circle-of-competence/). It’s just as important to know what you don’t know as it is to know what you know.\n\nIf you know what you don’t know, you might still have to make a decision, but your approaches for making that decision will change. For example, if you’re forced to make a decision in an area that you know is well outside your circle of competence, one tool you can use is [inversion](https://fs.blog/2013/10/inversion/).\n\nWhile there are millions of factors that go into decisions, there will always be a few variables and factors that will carry the bulk of the weight. If you’re operating within your circle of competence, it should be relatively easy to figure out the relevant variables and forces at play.\n\nI can’t tell you the relevant variables. There is no magic formula. To make consistently good decisions, you need to develop a deep fluency in the area in which you are making decisions, and you need to pull in the big ideas from multiple disciplines to make sure you’re exercising good judgment.\n\n## 2\\. The Psychological Factors\n\nThere are many causes of human misjudgment, including over-confidence. These are the subtle ways that your mind might be leading you astray at a subconscious level. Your subconscious mind is larger than your conscious mind, and yet we rarely pay attention to how we might be tricking ourselves. One way to mislead yourself, for instance, is to make decisions based on a small sample size and extrapolate the results to a larger population. Another way we fool ourselves is to remain committed to something we’ve said in the past. We might rely on an authority figure or default to what everyone else is doing. You get the idea.\n\nUsually, when we have extreme success or failure, there are four or five factors working in the same direction. The same goes for psychology. The more human misjudgment factors there are working against us, the more likely we are to make an ill-informed decision.\n",

And yet we see others—and ourselves—throw away something far more valuable every day: Time.\n\nUnlike the predictable reaction we have to someone throwing away money (_they’re crazy_), we often fail to think of the person who wastes time as crazy. The amount of time we get is uncertain, yet we know it’s limited. We can’t make any more of it.\n\nThe Roman philosopher **[Seneca](https://fs.blog/intellectual-giants/seneca/)** said it well in a letter to **Paulinus**:\n\n> It is not that we have a short space of time, but that we waste much of it. Life is long enough, and it has been given in sufficiently generous measure to allow the accomplishment of the very greatest things if the whole of it is well invested. But when it is squandered in luxury and carelessness, when it is devoted to no good end, forced at last by the ultimate necessity we perceive that it has passed away before we were aware that it was passing.So it is—the life we receive is not short, but we make it so, nor do we have any lack of it, but are wasteful of it.\n> \n> \\[…\\]\n> \n> I cannot doubt the truth of that utterance which the greatest of poets delivered with all the seeming of an oracle: “The part of life we really live is small.” For all the rest of existence is not life, but merely time. Vices beset us and surround us on every side, and they do not permit us to rise anew and lift up our eyes for the discernment of truth, but they keep us down when once they have overwhelmed us and we are chained to lust. Their victims are never allowed to return to their true selves; if ever they chance to find some release, like the waters of the deep sea which continue to heave even after the storm is past, they are tossed about and no rest from their lusts abides.\n\nThe language of wealth is time. The reason most of us want to get wealthy is for freedom of time. We want a clean schedule. We want to say no to things we don’t want to do. In essence, we want to spend money to buy time.\n\nYou will never be wealthy as long as you are spending time to create money.\n\n> A man who dares to waste an hour of time has not discovered the value of his life.\n> \n> Charles darwin\n\nWealth is best expressed by spending money to create time. As Warren Buffett reportedly said, “The rich invest in time; the poor invest in money.”\n\nTime is one of the most under-appreciated [mental models](https://fs.blog/mental-models/), and yet it applies to every situation.\n\nWhen time is spent without consideration, it becomes a persistent source of regret. How many times do you catch yourself ‘wasting time online,’ spending hours on Instagram not learning anything?\n\n## Four Ways We Misunderstand Time\n\n**1\\. Productivity:** We actually don’t want to be more productive. What we really want is more time. And yet because we don’t properly value time, we never end up with more; even when we find ways to work more efficiently, we don’t actually use it wisely. We simply layer in more work.\n\n**2\\. Investing in Learning:** The upfront costs are real and visible and, like any investment, the future payoff is uncertain. So we tend to skim the surface, thinking this will “save us time” versus doing the real work. Yet this surface-based approach leads to no improvement in our ability to make decisions. In fact, it may harm us if we think we’ve learned something for real. Thus, surface learning is a _true_ waste of time. It’s just that the link to our bad learning is unclear, so we rarely identify the root cause.\n\n**3\\. Relationships:** We’re often too “busy” to spend time with the ones we care about. The very parent at the park playing on his iPhone while his children run around playing and laughing is the same one, who, when you fast-forward the axis of time, wants those precious moments back. Likewise, the “busy” 30-something who can’t make time to see their parents wishes to have them back after they’re gone. They wish for more _time_ with them.\n\n**4\\. Meetings:** Meetings are part of how many of us earn a living. Often, however, they’re poorly organized and poorly run. Lacking an agenda or decision, they become nothing more than half a meeting half-a-gossip session. A giant waste of time.\n\nTime is invisible, so it’s easy to spend. It’s only near the end of our lives that most of us will realize the value of time. Make sure you’re not [too busy to pay attention to life](https://fs.blog/too-busy/).\n\nReal wealth is not created by spending your time making money, but by spending your money to create time. After all, no one is going to pay you to spend time with your kids, take your parter on a date, or give back to the community.\n",

At the end of each chapter write a few bullet points that summarize what you’ve read and make it personal if you can — that is, apply it to something in your life. Also, note any unanswered questions. When you’re done the book, put it down for a week.\n2.  Pick up the book again and go through all your notes. Most of these will be garbage but there will be lots you want to remember. Write the good stuff on the inside cover of the book along with a page number.\n3.  (Optional) Copy out the excerpts by hand or take a picture of them to pop into Evernote. Tag accordingly.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nI’ve been asked to how to take notes while reading a lot. Often what people are really getting at is how can I better focus, retain, and use what I’m reading. And taking notes while reading can supercharge all of these things if you do it right. However, when we’re taught how to read read, we’re not allowed to write in books. So we never really learn a system for taking notes that we can use as adults.\n\nThe first step to taking notes is to figure out why you are taking notes. If you’re studying for an exam your notes are going to look different than if you’re reading for entertainment. The way you take notes depends on the reason you’re taking notes.\n\nLearning something new as an adult is a function of consuming information ([what you read](https://medium.com/personal-growth/what-you-spend-time-reading-changes-your-brain-ee2ab4f2aa17#.ta4q3fguz) and [how you read](https://fs.blog/how-to-read-a-book/)), the information you retain, and your ability to put what you learned into practice (recognize patterns). For this, I use a simple three-step note-taking process that scales up to 150 books a year.\n\nLike almost everything in life, there is no magical answer that fits everyone. You’ll have to do a bit of trial and error and take what works for you.\n\n## Taking Notes While Reading\n\n**Step One.**The first thing I do when I pick up a book is read the preface, the table of contents, and the inside jacket. Often, I’ll glance over the index too. This doesn’t take long and often saves me time, as a lot of books do not make it past this filter. Maybe it doesn’t contain the information I’m trying to gain. If it seems crappy, I’ll flip to a few random pages to verify.\n\nThis filter is a form of **[systematic skimming](https://fs.blog/how-to-read-a-book/).** This isn’t my term, Mortimer Adler, a guy who literally [wrote the book on reading](https://fs.blog/how-to-read-a-book/), came up with it. Adler says there are four levels of reading. I tend to blend inspectional reading and analytical reading together for most books.\n\nThis way, when I start reading a book, I have an idea what it’s about, the main argument, and some of the terminology involved. I know where the author is going to take me and the broad strokes of how they will bring me along. That’s very useful information.\n\nWhile reading, I take notes. I circle words I need to look up. I star points that I think are critical to the argument. I underline anything that strikes me as interesting. I comment like a madman in the margins. I try to tease out assumptions, etc.\n\nEssentially, I’m trying to engage in a conversation with the author. Maybe my questions will be answered on the next page or in the next chapter. Maybe I’ll need to find another book to answer them. Who knows. But I write them down.\n\nAt the end of each chapter, I write a few bullet points that summarize what I’ve just read. When I’m done, I write a brief summary of the entire book and then I do something few other people do. I let the book age.\n\nI put the book on my desk and I won’t touch it for anywhere from a few days to a week. This is very important.\n\n**Step two.**  \nWhen I pick the book up again, I re-read every scribble, underline, and comment I’ve made (assuming I can still read my writing). Sometimes I can’t.\n\nI’m not the same person I was the first time I read the book, two things have changed: (1) I’ve read the entire book and (2) I’ve had a chance to sleep on what may have seemed earth-shattering at the time but now just seems meh.\n\nIf something still strikes my interest, I write a note in the first few pages of the book, in my own words, on the topic. Often this is a summary but increasingly it’s ways to apply the knowledge. I index this to the page number in the book.\n\nSometimes, and this depends on the book, I’ll create a sort of mental summary of the book’s main arguments and gaps. Sometimes I’ll cross-link points with other books.\n\n**Step 3 (optional but highly effective).**  \nWait a few days. Then go through the book and copy out excerpts by hand and put them into your repository or commonplace book. I use these notes to connect and synthesize ideas as I read.\n\nTo aid recall, connect the ideas to something you already have in your mind. Is it a con",

Swanson is the former chairman and CEO of Raytheon Company.\n\nOriginally a part of a presentation to engineers and scientists at Raytheon, someone asked him to write his rules down.\n\nThankfully he listened, the result is [Swanson’s Unwritten Rules of Management](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FH6A1Q/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=farnamstreet-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B000FH6A1Q&linkId=9b178f4b4249041a78ee09cc5f77a0ba).\n\nNot all of the rules are Swanson’s. Some of them were published in 1944 in [The Unwritten Laws of Engineering](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0317336320/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=farnamstreet-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0317336320&linkId=78939af91f774f34a1fbc7a6e24fedc3) by W. J. King. (The book was [updated](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0791801624/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=farnamstreet-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0791801624&linkId=dc42dd8a5321f8c2221c5d9350b28bb9) in the early 2000’s by James G. Skakoon.)\n\nIn The Unwritten Rules of Management, Swanson elaborates on these rules with a paragraph or two.\n\n1.  Learn to say, “I don’t know.” If used when appropriate, it will be often.\n2.  It is easier to get into something than it is to get out of it.\n3.  If you are not criticized, you may not be doing much.\n4.  Look for what is missing. Many know how to improve what’s there, but few can see what isn’t there.\n5.  Presentation rule: When something appears on a slide presentation, assume the world knows about it, and deal with it accordingly.\n6.  Work for a boss to whom you can tell it like it is. Remember that you can’t pick your relatives, but you can pick your boss.\n7.  Constantly review developments to make sure that the actual benefits are what they are supposed to be. Avoid Newton’s Law.\n8.  However menial and trivial your early assignments may appear, give them your best efforts.\n9.  Persistence or tenacity is the disposition to persevere in spite of difficulties, discouragement, or indifference. Don’t be known as a good starter but a poor finisher.\n10.  In doing your project, don’t wait for others; go after them, and make sure it gets done.\n11.  Confirm the instructions you give others, and their commitments, in writing. Don’t assume it will get done!\n12.  Don’t be timid; speak up. Express yourself, and promote your ideas.\n13.  Practice shows that those who speak the most knowingly and confidently often end up with the assignment to get the job done.\n14.  Strive for brevity and clarity in oral and written reports.\n15.  Be extremely careful of the accuracy of your statements.\n16.  Don’t overlook the fact that you are working for a boss. Keep him or her informed. Whatever the boss wants, within the bounds of integrity, takes top priority.\n17.  Promises, schedules, and estimates are important instruments in a well-ordered business. You must make promises — don’t lean on the often-used phrase, “I can’t estimate it because it depends upon many uncertain factors.”\n18.  Never direct a complaint to the top. A serious offense is to “cc” a person’s boss on a copy of a complaint before the person has a chance to respond to the complaint.\n19.  When dealing with outsiders, remember that you represent the company. Be especially careful of your commitments.\n20.  Cultivate the habit of boiling matters down to the simplest terms. An elevator speech is the best way.\n21.  Don’t get excited in engineering emergencies. Keep your feet on the ground.\n22.  Cultivate the habit of making quick, clean-cut decisions.\n23.  When making decisions, the “pros” are much easier to deal with than the “cons.” Your boss wants to see them both.\n24.  Don’t ever lose your sense of humor.\n25.  Have fun at what you do. It will reflect in your work. No one likes a grump except another grump!\n26.  Treat the name of your company as if it were your own.\n27.  Beg for the bad news.\n28.  You remember 1/3 of what you read, 1/2 of what people tell you, but 100% of what you feel.\n29.  You can’t polish a sneaker. (Don’t waste effort putting the finishing touches on something that has little substance to begin with.)\n30.  When facing issues or problems that are becoming drawn-out, “short them to the ground.”\n31.  When faced with decisions, try to look at them as if you were one level up in the organization. Your perspective will change quickly.\n32.  A person who is nice to you but rude to the waiter — or to others — is not a nice person. (This rule never fails.)\n",

This work is what most people avoid.\n\n> I never allow myself to have an opinion on anything that I don’t know the other side’s argument better than they do.\n> \n> — **Charlie Munger**\n\nThe work to hold an opinion isn’t just about accumulating facts and information that support your argument. To truly hold an opinion, you must:\n\n*   Deeply understand arguments from multiple sides\n*   Seek out contradictory evidence rather than hiding from it\n*   Test your thinking against the strongest counterarguments\n*   Consider how you might be fooling yourself\n\nSomeone who has done this work stands apart. Not only can they explain their position at depth, and argue from multiple perspectives, but they also remain calm when challenged. They possess a rare intellectual honesty—changing their mind when evidence demands it.\n\n> We all are learning, modifying, or destroying ideas all the time. Rapid destruction of your ideas when the time is right is one of the most valuable qualities you can acquire. You must force yourself to consider arguments on the other side.\n> \n> — Charlie Munger\n\nDarwin exemplified this approach. Rather than dismissing contradictory facts, he actively collected them, knowing his theory had to account for all evidence, not just the convenient parts.\n\nThe ultimate test of understanding: Can you argue against your position better than your best critics? If not, you haven’t earned your opinion.\n\nThis standard is expensive. It takes time. People who hold themselves to it don’t pretend to know everything. As Maimonides wisely said: “Teach thy tongue to say ‘I do not know,’ and thou shalt progress.”\n\nThe world overflows with superficial takes from people who scan headlines and regurgitate others’ thoughts. They’re easy to outthink if you don’t let them waste your time.\n\nWhen faced with strongly opinionated people, ask them to write down their reasoning. Most won’t bother—revealing volumes. Those who do expose their thinking to scrutiny—fuzzy logic has nowhere to hide on paper.\n\nThe ability to do this intellectual work is rare. The payoff is enormous.\n\n> The ability to destroy your ideas rapidly instead of slowly when the occasion is right is one of the most valuable things. You have to work hard on it. Ask yourself what are the arguments on the other side. It’s bad to have an opinion you’re proud of if you can’t state the arguments for the other side better than your opponents.

I call this the wrong side of right.\n\nPeople never work as hard as they do when they are trying to prove themselves right. They unconsciously hold on to the ideas and evidence that reinforce their beliefs and dismiss anything that counters. When this happens, it’s not about the best outcome, it’s about protecting your ego. If you’ve made this mistake, you’re not the only one.\n\n> You should take the approach that you, the entrepreneur, are wrong. Your goal is to be less wrong.\n> \n> — Elon Musk\n\nOne of the biggest differences between running a company and working for a company is how you tend to think about solving problems. As a knowledge worker employed by someone else, I wanted to be right. I saw being right as how I proved my worth to both myself and the company. The best outcome was my being right. Because …\n\nIf I wasn’t right, then what was I? Wrong?\n\nBut … I couldn’t be wrong. My ego wouldn’t let me.\n\nOther people? They could be wrong. But not me.\n\nIf I was wrong, then what was I?\n\nI worked toward my solution and not the best outcome that was possible.\n\nFor the longest time, I thought that if the winning idea wasn’t my idea, it meant I was somehow less. I thought no one would see me as valuable. No one would see me as insightful. People would think I wasn’t adding value. And worse, I’d see myself as not contributing.\n\nI was wrong.\n\n> Avoid having your ego so close to your position that when your position falls, your ego goes with it.\n> \n> — Colin Powell\n\nI had so much of my identity wrapped up in being right that I was blind to [how the world really works](https://fs.blog/joseph-tussman/).\n\nAt Farnam Street, one of our principles is that we work with the world as it really is, not as we want it to be. My desire to be right reflected how I wanted the world to work, not how it actually worked. Instead of trying to be right, I try to [be less wrong](https://fs.blog/inversion/).\n\nThe most important lesson I’ve learned from running a company is that the more I give up trying to be right, the better the outcomes get for everyone. I don’t care who gets the credit. I care about creating the best possible work.[  \n](https://fs.blog/2015/10/four-types-of-relationships/)\n",

When the pilot announced that we’d be circling Heathrow for 20 minutes, I was the only one happy. I only had a few pages left.\n\nIn a way Sugar’s advice columns — combined into the amazing collection _[Tiny Beautiful Things: Advice on Love and Life from Dear Sugar](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307949338/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=farnamstreet-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0307949338&linkId=4631ca8f33fbb6e52a8c081baa00dc93)_ — represents an ad hoc memoir.\n\n“But it’s a memoir with an agenda,” Strayed’s friend Steve Almond writes in the introduction, “With great patience, and eloquence, (Sugar) assures her readers that within the chaos of our shame and disappointment and rage there is meaning, and within that meaning is the possibility of rescue.”\n\n> Inexplicable sorrows await all of us. … Life isn’t some narcissistic game you play online. It all matters— every sin, every regret, every affliction.\n\nOne of my favorite letters, the one for which the book is titled, comes in response to this question.\n\n> _Dear Sugar,_\n> \n> I read your column religiously. I’m twenty-two. From what I can tell by your writing, you’re in your early forties. My question is short and sweet: What would you tell your twentysomething self if you could talk to her now?\n> \n> Love, Seeking Wisdom\n\nThink, dear reader, for a moment on what you would respond before continuing.\n\nHere is what Sugar, or should I say, Cheryl, had to say.\n\nThese words will touch your soul.\n\n> Dear Seeking Wisdom,\n> \n> Stop worrying about whether you’re fat. You’re not fat. Or rather, you’re sometimes a little bit fat, but who gives a shit? There is nothing more boring and fruitless than a woman lamenting the fact that her stomach is round.

You don’t need a reason to leave. Wanting to leave is enough. Leaving doesn’t mean you’re incapable of real love or that you’ll never love anyone else again. It doesn’t mean you’re morally bankrupt or psychologically demented or a nymphomaniac. It means you wish to change the terms of one particular relationship. That’s all. Be brave enough to break your own heart.\n> \n> When that really sweet but fucked-up gay couple invites you over to their cool apartment to do Ecstasy with them, say no.\n> \n> There are some things you can’t understand yet. Your life will be a great and continuous unfolding. It’s good you’ve worked hard to resolve childhood issues while in your twenties, but understand that what you resolve will need to be resolved again. And again. You will come to know things that can only be known with the wisdom of age and the grace of years. Most of those things will have to do with forgiveness.\n> \n> One evening you will be rolling around on the wooden floor of your apartment with a man who will tell you he doesn’t have a condom.

Be true blue. You are a writer because you write. Keep writing and quit your bitching. Your book has a birthday. You don’t know what it is yet.\n> \n> You cannot convince people to love you. This is an absolute rule. No one will ever give you love because you want him or her to give it. Real love moves freely in both directions. Don’t waste your time on anything else.\n> \n> Most things will be okay eventually, but not everything will be. Sometimes you’ll put up a good fight and lose. Sometimes you’ll hold on really hard and realize there is no choice but to let go. Acceptance is a small, quiet room.\n> \n> One hot afternoon during the era in which you’ve gotten yourself ridiculously tangled up with heroin, you will be riding the bus and thinking what a worthless piece of crap you are when a little girl will get on the bus holding the strings of two purple balloons.

Which classmate would you pick and why?\n\n“Are you going to pick the one with the highest IQ?” asks Buffett. “Are you going to pick the guy who can throw a football the farthest? The one with the highest grades? What qualities will cause you to pick them?”\n\nThen he changes things up again. Who would you think least likely to succeed? Why?\n\nHe asks the students to take out a sheet of paper and list the positive attributes on the left and the negative ones on the right.\n\nInevitably, the most useful qualities have nothing to do with IQ, grades, or family connections. People pick based on generosity, kindness, and integrity.\n\nHe then asks the students which of the qualities they are incapable of having and which they are incapable of stopping?\n\n“To Buffett, the answer is none,” writes Michael Eisner in [Working Together: Why Great Partnerships Succeed](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0055X53ZO/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B0055X53ZO&linkCode=as2&tag=farnamstreet-20). “These qualities are choices people make. People decide whether or not to be generous, they decide whether or not to take credit for things they didn’t do, whether or not to keep score in life, whether or not to be envious.”\n\nIt’s quite simple in the end. Develop qualities from the left and try to stop doing the ones on the right.\n\n“You’re looking for three things, generally, in a person,” says Buffett. “Intelligence, energy, and integrity. And if they don’t have the last one, don’t even bother with the first two. I tell them, ‘Everyone here has the intelligence and energy—you wouldn’t be here otherwise. But the integrity is up to you. You weren’t born with it, you can’t learn it in school.”\n\nBuffett and Munger were fortunate. They were both smart and worked hard to improve that advantage. The integrity, however, they chose.\n\n“You decide to be dishonest, stingy, uncharitable, egotistical, all the things people don’t like in other people,” argues Warren. “They are all choices. Some people think there’s a limited little pot of admiration to go around, and anything the other guy takes out of the pot, there’s less left for you. But it’s just the opposite.”\n",

What remains are the essentials. If you know the first principles of something, you can build the rest of your knowledge around them to produce something new.\n\nWhile you could take this way of thinking down to an atomic level, a lot of value is gained by simply going a level or two deeper than most people. Solutions are based on what you see. Different answers reveal themselves at different levels.\n\nIf I hand you a house made from Lego blocks, you know it’s possible to make a house. Thinking at the first layer, you might move a few blocks around and, in the process, slightly improve the house. Most people stop here. They are presented with something that already exists and they endeavor to make it slightly better. Going a layer deeper and breaking the Lego house into individual pieces opens the door to possibility: not only can you build a better house, you can build something entirely different.\n\nEverything that exists is effectively a set of Lego blocks, assembled in a certain way, that can be taken apart and reassembled. A bike is just a seat, chain, body, handlebars, etc. Breaking the bike down into its parts allows you to reassemble the parts into something new. However, you can also go deeper, melting the parts into their core metals and making a shield, sword, or anything else, limited only by material and imagination.\n\n> I don’t know what’s the matter with people: they don’t learn by understanding; they learn by some other way—by rote or something. Their knowledge is so fragile!\n> \n> Richard Feynman\n\n## The Basics\n\nThe idea of building knowledge from first principles has a long tradition in philosophy. In the Western canon, it goes back to Plato, with significant contributions from Aristotle and Descartes. Essentially, these thinkers sought foundational knowledge that would remain constant and serve as a basis for building everything else, from our ethical systems to our social structures.\n\n![First Principles](https://fs.blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/first-principles-white.jpg)\n\nFirst principles thinking doesn’t have to be quite so grand. When we do it, we aren’t necessarily looking for absolute truths—millennia of epistemological inquiry have shown us that these are hard to come by, and the scientific method has demonstrated that knowledge can be built only when we are actively trying to falsify it. Rather, first principles thinking identifies the elements that are, in the context of any given situation, irreducible.\n\nFirst principles do not provide a checklist of things that will always be true; our understanding of first principles evolves as we gain more knowledge. They are the foundation on which we must build, and thus will be different in every situation—but the more we know, the more we can challenge. For example, if we are considering how to improve the energy efficiency of a refrigerator, the laws of thermodynamics can be taken as first principles. However, a theoretical chemist or physicist might want to explore entropy, and thus further break the second law of thermodynamics into its underlying principles and the assumptions that were made because of them.\n\n> “To understand is to know what to do.”\n> \n> — Wittgenstein\n\n## Techniques for Establishing First Principles\n\nIf we never learn to take something apart, test our assumptions about it, and reconstruct it, we end up bound by what other people tell us is possible. We end up trapped in the way things have always been done. When the environment changes, we just continue as if things were the same, making costly mistakes along the way.\n\nSome of us are naturally skeptical of what we’re told: Maybe it doesn’t match up to our experiences. Maybe it’s something that used to be true but isn’t true anymore. Or maybe we just think differently about something. When it comes down to it, everything that is not a law of nature is just a shared belief. Money is a shared belief. So is a border. So is Bitcoin. So is love. The list goes on.\n\nThere are two techniques we can use to change the level where we are looking at a situation, identify the first principles, and cut through the dogma and shared belief: Socratic questioning and the Five Whys.\n\n### Socratic Questioning\n\nSocratic questioning can be used to establish first principles through stringent analysis. This a disciplined questioning process, used to establish truths, reveal underlying assumptions, and separate knowledge from ignorance. The key distinction between Socratic questioning and normal discussions is that the former seeks to draw out first principles in a systematic manner. Socratic questioning generally follows this process:\n\n1.  Clarifying your thinking and explaining the origins of your ideas (Why do I think this? What e",

In the end, it’s not the failures that define us so much as how we respond. We all get steered off course at some point in our lives. What really counts isn’t that we make mistakes but the choices that follow those mistakes.\n\nA teen who gets in trouble with the law, for example, can accept responsibility for his actions, change his behavior, and go on to lead the nation, or he can see only failure and tumble into a vicious cycle of committing ever-larger crimes.\n\nIt’s not that you stumble, it’s that you get back up. It’s not that you did something wrong but that you realize what’s happening and change. It’s not that you messed up as a friend or lover, it’s that you see ways you can be better. Having the wrong priorities is bad enough, but realizing that and refusing to change is worse. It’s not that you never took the time to smell the roses and admire the sunset; it’s that once you realize this, you take the time to notice.\n\n> “Success is never final. Failure is never fatal. It’s courage that counts.”\n> \n> — John Wooden\n\nMistakes are bad, no doubt, but not learning from them is worse. The key to learning from mistakes is to admit them without excuses or defensiveness, rub your nose in them a little, and make the changes you need to make to grow going forward. If you can’t admit your mistakes, you won’t grow.\n\n_“I like people admitting they were complete stupid horses’ asses._ _I know I’ll perform better if I rub my nose in my mistakes._  _This is a wonderful trick to learn.”_  \n— Charlie Munger\n\n_“Forgetting your mistakes is a terrible error if you are trying to improve your cognition… Why not celebrate stupidities!”_  \n— Charlie Munger\n\n_“If anyone can refute me – show me I’m making a mistake or looking at things from the wrong perspective — I’ll gladly change.
